<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p>Oxford, they tell us, is the home
of movements; Cambridge the home
of men. Certainly the miniature movement
that took shape in this little book
was inspired by a Cambridge man. It
was at an Oxford tea-party, where
the talk had been unashamedly of
mountains and their metaphysic, that
Mr. G. Winthrop Young gave the
first impulse to the scheme that ultimately
produced this collection of essays.
To Mr. Young the editor and contributors
have been indebted for constant help
and advice. He has heartened the
despondent, and has inked cold daylight
into more than one ‘sunset’
passage.</p>

<p>At Oxford there are a number of Alpine
clubs. The oldest and most sedate meets
once a year in New College Hall. A less
dignified association meets at irregular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
intervals <i>on</i> New College Hall and other
hospitable roofs. Lastly, there is a genial
little society which owed its beginnings
to some twenty undergraduates who
agreed they could spare an occasional
arduous evening to the revival of their
Alpine memories. One confiding member
bought a lantern, and has since
endeavoured&mdash;with indifferent success&mdash;to
recoup himself out of spasmodic
subscriptions. We shall none of us
forget the first meeting. In our innocence
we had hoped that a scientist
might know something of electricity,
and Mr. Bourdillon was in consequence
entrusted with the lantern. After much
hissing on the part of the machine,
and of the audience, a faint glow
appeared on the sheet, and enveloped
in a halo of restless hues we dimly discerned
the dome of Mont Blanc. A
pathetic voice from behind the lantern
sadly inquired whether we would ‘prefer
Mont Blanc green and spluttering or
yellow and steady.’ The chairman then
proceeded to read a paper illustrated or
rather misrepresented by lantern slides,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
and at the conclusion proposed a very
hearty vote of thanks to himself for his
interesting and entertaining lecture. The
House then divided, and the motion was
lost by an overwhelming majority. The
minutes also record that a member moved
to inhibit the secretary of the Church
Union from issuing a printed prayer
for ‘faith to remove mountains.’ This
motion was lost, as Mr. Tyndale ably
pointed out the value of a publication
that might facilitate the transfer of
some superfluous mountains from the
Alps to the monotonous surroundings
of Oxford.</p>

<p>The members of this learned society
furnished the majority of our contributors.
‘Conscious as we are of
one another’s deficiencies,’ we view with
misgiving the publication of these
essays. We have no virgin ascents, no
climbs of desperate difficulty, to record.
Our justification must rest on other
grounds.</p>

<p>In a paper memorable for the circumstances
of its delivery, and the dramatic
irony of its concluding words, Donald
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
Robertson pleaded for a simpler treatment
of our mountain worship, and
claimed that there was ‘still room for
a man to tell freely and without false
shame the simple story of a day among
the mountains.’ And this is what some
of us have attempted.</p>

<p>And further, although there scarce
remains a great Alpine ridge untrodden
by man, though the magic words&mdash;‘No
information’&mdash;are rapidly vanishing
from the pages of the <i>Climber’s Guides</i>,
yet as subjects for literary, artistic, and
philosophic inquiry, the mountains are
far from exhausted. The basic emotions
of the hills, at once bold and subtle,
remain an almost untouched field, and
many a curious by-path in the psychology
of mountaineering has yet to
be explored.</p>

<p>Those of us who have ventured to
approach our theme in such subjective
fashion, who have tried to give something
more than a plain record of a
climb, who may even have attempted
to interpret the secrets of the hills, have
probably only courted failure and earned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
ridicule. But at least we have started
on a stirring venture, and we shall consider
it successful if only a word here
or there serves to recall some forgotten
picture, some early romantic impression,
to any reader for whom mountains,
nature, or wandering have perhaps lost
their first halo of romance.</p>

<p>It may be said that greater and more
modest mountaineers have waited the
experience of years before embodying
their reflections in the written word.
This reproof leaves us unmoved, for we
are only concerned with the message
the hills hold for Youth, a message
which Youth therefore may be pardoned
for attempting to explain. Each age
hears different accents in the mountain
voices. To the old mountaineer the
riven lines of cliff may speak of failing
strength or inevitable decay. For the
child the white far gates may hide an
unknown kingdom of magic. But
active Youth need fear no comparison
of strength, need draw no moral from
decay. For him the gates that childhood
could not pass have opened, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
disclosed a wonderland ‘more real than
childhood’s fairy trove,’ a country of
difficult romance, and of perpetual challenge
to the undying instincts of knight
errantry and young adventure.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Mountains</span>, more than any
other of the features of nature,
are fundamental, synthetic. They
present, untrammelled and without elaboration,
the great basic principles on
which they are built; their structure
has absolute unity, their monumental
architecture is simple. Their moods
are the moods of primitive humanity,
their spirit, like their form, is unmodified,
above and below civilisation.
Every climber must, at one time or another,
have shuddered before the hatred
of an Alpine peak, the hatred of all that
is primeval in nature for all that is
artificially progressive in man. I remember
one evening sitting above the
Col de Vosa and watching the glow
of the sunset on Mont Blanc. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
entire range of peaks from the Dôme
du Goûter to the Aiguille Verte blazed
with colour down to a point a little
above where the ragged fringe of the
moraines slide into the grassy upland.
There a hard line of shadow reflected
the contour of the hill on which I sat.
As the sun sank, this line of shadow
crept up the mountain-side with almost
visible speed, till only the topmost
pinnacles kept their colour, like a row
of beacon-lights flaming above the
darkened valley. Gradually they in their
turn paled and died.</p>

<p>But it is now, when most onlookers
turn away, that the mountains begin
to live. When the fire has left the
snow, when the rock ridges leap out
cold and black, when the fissures of
the ice cliffs yawn pitilessly once again,
the real character of the place is shown.
The mountains are cruel and angry.
Traffic with them is not friendship,
but war. All the mountaineer’s thrill
of conquest is the thrill of victory over
an enemy, an enemy who hates as men
hate, as the ancient hates the upstart
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
or the lonely giant, the puny multitude,
but whose resources are endless and
whose ally is the storm.</p>

<p>Snow mountains are seldom friendly.
Sometimes they seem to smile, but
their welcome, for all its glitter, is
treacherous and cruel. With lower
hills the case is rather different. The
rock precipices and windy fells of Cumberland,
the spaces of the Yorkshire
moors, have an individuality as complete
as Mont Blanc, but less overwhelming.
Their anger is sullen, their moods more
passive. At times they are almost
gracious, but the difference is one of degree
only. The quality of their emotion
sees no variant in glacier and heather.</p>

<p>It would seem that any normal sensibility
could in some measure appreciate
these mountain moods, and, where the
observer is an artist, reproduce them in
line and colour.... And yet it is only in
our own day that a painter has appeared
with a proper understanding of their
true existence. In art the coming of
landscape was slow, but the mountain,
as a mountain, has come more slowly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
still. Why this neglect? Why, until
long after the landscape picture had become
a commonplace, was the mountain
not disentangled from the myriad aspects
of nature and made the object of artistic
interpretation?</p>

<p>Several reasons may be suggested. In
the first place, for true appreciation
more than a mere acquaintance is necessary.
Mountains are reserved. They
extend no real welcome even when they
do not actively resent familiarity. Only
patient perseverance can gauge their real
significance. The men of old hated
them. Perhaps as they watched from
afar the towering army of the Alps,
there came to them on the breeze some
breath of mountain anger, and they
trembled, hardly knowing why. To
them the hills were just so many hideous
obstacles to war or commerce. To make
a way through them was a task to be
dreaded. It needs a rare vision to see
beauty beyond danger, to recognise the
sublime in the menace of death.</p>

<p>But, apart from this, it is doubtful
whether the mediæval mind could have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
grasped the essentials of mountain scenery
had it striven to do so&mdash;and this is the
second reason for delay. The synthetic
vision, the subordination of part to a
whole, is not really primitive. The
savage sees individual objects in strong
unhampered outline, but he cannot relate
them. His decorative sense lacks cohesion.
This very lack is the weakness of
Egyptian wall-painting, where harmony
of line and movement reaches a point seldom
achieved since those early days, but
where the feeling of a procession is rarely
lost owing to the failure to relate the
figures and objects to each other. It
needs a new hypercivilised primitivism&mdash;to
use what appears a contradiction in
terms&mdash;extraordinarily subtle, backed by
a store of imagination and detailed knowledge,
which can by its very wisdom
select and discard, keeping the chain of
essentials, disregarding the rest. And no
one has greater need of this than the
mountain artist. It is equally useless for
him to reproduce, however skilfully,
every glacier, every gully on the mountain-side,
and to daub vague, unrelated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
lumps of paint one beside another. The
important artistic fact in a mountain
scene is the intricate rhythm of line and
slope, the true relation of curve to curve,
and this is obscured and lost in photographic
realism, as it is never realised in
the scribblings of a child. The mountain
artist must grasp every detail, but distinguish
what he requires and discard all
else. That is why in the early days of
landscape-painting the excitement of new
beauties inevitably caused overcrowded
pictures. There was no attempt at selection,
because the selective point of view
had, as yet, no appeal. The last thirty
years have brought it to the front.</p>

<p>The third reason for the tardy recognition
of mountains is expressed by the man
with whom this discussion is really concerned,
by Professor C. J. Holmes in his
monograph on Constable.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> ‘Mountains
have returned with the desire for design.’
The most significant feature of recent
painting is the renaissance of decoration.
The easel picture as Corot knew it has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
been eclipsed by the art of the fresco.
Design has replaced light as the central
study, just as light replaced the twilit
realism of the first ‘plein-airists.’ The
primitive Italians knew no landscape-painting
in our modern sense. The
value of mountains in design could not,
therefore, appeal to them; and so it is
left to the present day to employ for the
first time the mountains with their rhythm
and their feeling.</p>

<p>But such generalisation, unsuggested by
fact, can have little weight, and confirmation
of these statements must be found in
an outlined indication of the growth of the
landscape tradition, and, springing from
it, the treatment of mountains.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When European art began to elaborate
the religious conceptions with which it
was in early times mainly concerned,
landscapes were introduced as part of the
Bible stories. But they were purely
subordinate. Duccio and Giotto use
conventionalised trees and strange bare
rocks which, while evidence of wonderful
vision, show no sense of the value of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
landscape for itself. The delicate distances
of the Flemish primitives, the
backgrounds of Benozzo Gozzoli’s frescoes,
the settings of Cinquecento Madonnas,
are merely so much design to fill a space,
so many accessories to the figures in the
foreground. One would like to except
Patinir’s ‘Flight into Egypt,’<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> where the
thicket behind the Virgin has more than
a merely decorative significance, and shows
a loving study of trees and rocks, were
not the vistas to left and right pure
design. There are also rare landscape
studies of Dürer&mdash;one particularly, an
unfinished study of hills in the Ashmolean
Museum at Oxford&mdash;which are strikingly
ahead of their time in their sole preoccupation
with nature as distinct from
humanity.</p>

<p>But it is really with Dutch and
Flemish seventeenth-century art that
landscape for landscape’s sake makes its
appearance, with Rubens, Rembrandt,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
Koninck, van Goyen. However, to
them mountains are as accessory as was
nature generally for their predecessors.
To give composition, to round off a
landscape, to frame a vista, Rubens and
the great Dutchmen used hills and crags.
There are probably many exceptions to
this generalisation. To mention one
only, there is a picture by the Flemish
Millet (1642-1679) at Munich in which
a mountain occupies the centre of the
canvas. This mountain, though tree-covered,
forms the main element in the
painting, and despite the presence of
allegorical figures in the foreground, is
proof of a curiously modern interest in
hill-formation. In the main, however,
the contention is true that the mountain
in art does not appear in the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>The landscape tradition passed to
Claude, and then forked. One branch,
the English, produced Wilson, Crome,
Constable, Turner, and the water-colourists.
To the other belongs Poussin,
and through him the Barbizon school in
France. (It should here be noticed, at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
the risk of anticipating, that this last-named
group derived from Bonington a
large share of Constable’s influence, and
owe perhaps the greater part of their
inspiration to English sources.)</p>

<p>Traces now begin to appear of a love
of mountains for themselves. Crome’s
‘Slate Quarries,’ some of Wilson’s Welsh
pictures, many of Turner’s sketches, show
rocks and hills painted for their own
grandeur and beauty. Similarly, in much
of Corot’s early work&mdash;before 1830&mdash;bare
mountain-sides and wastes of rock
stand unadorned by trees or other counter-interests.</p>

<p>Of Constable we are told that ‘the
grandeur of hills weighed on him. He
wanted meadows,’<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> but Plate <small>III.</small> in the
book from which this quotation is taken
shows that he possessed a very real understanding
of mountains.</p>

<p>The recognition proved only momentary,
and was soon lost in conventional
trickery. In England the water-colourists
began once more to use mountains merely
to break the level of a landscape, to give
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
a pleasing variety. The idea of depicting
them solely for themselves becomes
actually abhorrent. An extract from
William Gilpin’s <i>Essays on Landscape-painting</i>
will show the attitude which
became general to the early English
school:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘In landscape-painting smooth objects
would produce no composition
at all. In a mountain scene what
composition could arise from one
smooth knoll coming forward on one
side, intersected by a smooth knoll
on the other, with a smooth plain
perhaps in the middle and a smooth
mountain in the distance? The very
idea is disgusting.’<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p></blockquote>

<p>To prove the awful result he reproduces
a drawing in his book done on
these very lines, a drawing so superior to
all the other illustrations in the volume
as to show how utterly tastes have changed
and advanced since his time.</p>

<p>Again:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘The beauty of a distant mountain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
depends on the line it traces
along the sky.... Such forms as
suggest the idea of lumpish heaviness
are disgusting&mdash;round, swelling
forms without any break to disencumber
them of their weight.</p>

<p>‘Mountains in composition are
considered as single objects and
follow the same rules;&mdash;if they join
heavily together in lumpish shapes,
if they fall into each other at right
angles, or if their lines run parallel&mdash;in
all these cases the combination
will be more or less disgusting.’<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Barbizon painting underwent a change
somewhat similar to that just described
in England. Corot altered his manner
and evolved the graceful greenery and
scenes of trees and water for which he
is admired to-day. It is perhaps to be
regretted that he exchanged his strong
renderings of mountain and rock for
twilight fantasies which, for all their
lyrical charm, slide frequently into sentimentality
and prettiness. His fellow-landscape-painters,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
Rousseau, Daubigny,
Dupré, and the veteran Harpignies, used
mountains either not at all or merely as
incidents in a panorama. Courbet alone,
the greatest of them all, continued to the
last his rugged studies of cliff and slope,
blending the romantic tradition with the
realist, supplying, as the first real painter
of rocks, a noble and fearless link between
the ideal and the selective. In true
modern landscape the influence of Courbet
appears again and again, strengthening
and vigorous.</p>

<p>With the coming of Impressionist
painting no marked advance is noticeable.
Monet and his followers are concerned
with light and colour, not with form.
Dutch Impressionism&mdash;the Hague school
With its curious mixture of seventeenth-century
genre tradition and modern
French landscape methods&mdash;keeps to
trees and sky. It would be unreasonable
indeed to look for the birth of the
mountain in art to take place in Holland!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before passing on to the latest phase of
European painting, some attention must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
be given to the art of the Far East. China,
Japan, India, loom large in the history
of the landscape tradition, and especially
in its newest development, where their influence,
as will be seen, has been very great.</p>

<p>In the art of the Far East, whether
theoretical or practical, there are traces
from the earliest times of a conception
of landscape and of its bearing on art
somewhat similar to that of Wordsworth.
The early Chinese in their aphorisms and
paintings loved to express the majesty of
mountains. ‘Rhythmic vitality, anatomical
structure, conformity with nature,
suitability of colouring, artistic composition
and finish are the six canons of art,’
wrote Hsieh-Ho in the sixth century <small>A.D.</small>,
and no subject could be more suitable
than a mountain for the application of
those canons. Through the later periods
of Chinese art, and during the history of
the painting of Japan, recurring cases
appear of the same inclination.</p>

<p>But there are differences of opinion
among the Eastern theorists. Here is
Kuo Hsi, who seems to be an early
Chinese incarnation of William Gilpin:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Hills without clouds look bare;
without water they are wanting in
fascination; without paths they are
wanting in life; without trees they
are dead; without depth-distance
they are shallow; without level-distance
they are near; and without
height-distance they are
low.’</p></blockquote>

<p>Indian art provides such a striking
parallel to the ideas of modern European
painting that it will be useful to return
to it when discussing the new movement.
It is sufficient here to say that an examination
of Indian landscape drawings will
reveal an interest in mountains similar
to and no less vivid than that of the
Japanese.</p>

<p>The interest in Eastern art began to
spread over Europe during the last half
of the nineteenth century. The de
Goncourt brothers and Whistler by
adopting some of the Japanese methods
familiarised their countrymen with the
ideas and practices of a hitherto little-known
art. The researches and writings
of Edmond de Goncourt, the flat, roomy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
arrangements of Whistler, struck a note
so new that a wild outcry greeted their
efforts. But the strangeness has worn
off. Whistler is accepted as a master;
Japanese prints are everywhere; and,
like the Spanish influence introduced by
Manet in the face of general execration,
the Eastern ideas have gone to produce
a new art.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>It was near the end of last century
that first appeared what has so misleadingly
been called Post-Impressionism,
an art with a new synthetic vision which
saw beyond realism, which repudiated
illusion, which tried to get deep down to
where life and beauty touch and so
externalise that indefinite something
which makes things what they always
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
seem to us to be. This art which has
recreated decoration, which is going to
revolutionise stage-craft, house furniture
and even building, while it deals unhesitatingly
with any subject, is perhaps
chiefly significant in its bearing on
landscape.</p>

<p>In this department appears that extraordinary
parallel with Indian ideas which
has already been mentioned. No Indian
artist ever aimed at a mere representation
of nature. He drew from his store of
imagination and memory a revisualised
landscape which suggests the idea behind
nature and not her seeming reality. To
him natural forms were merely incarnations
of ideas, and the effort to complete
the expression necessitated a repudiation
of illusion. It follows that the representative
science displayed appears inept, if
judged by ordinary outward standards.
But when one considers that accuracy is
purely relative, and that the synthetic
vision naturally subordinates certain
features in its preoccupation with
others, to condemn Indian drawing as
bad, or Byzantine either, for the case
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
is analogous, shows a faulty standard of
judgment.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>As in Indian, so in modern European
art, an understanding of the peculiar
ideas which have inspired is necessary
for appreciation. Keeping, therefore, this
fact in view, that the aim is not for illusion
but for the subtler and truer realism
which lies in all natural phenomena, we
can pass to the consideration of an artist
who stands at the head of ‘Post-Impressionist’&mdash;or,
as I prefer to call it, ‘Fauvist’&mdash;landscape
tradition, and who really
marks the beginning of the new appreciation
of mountains.</p>

<p>Paul Cézanne has waited longer than
any of his contemporaries for sympathy
and fame, but now that his time has
come he bids fair easily to outstrip
Manet and the Impressionists in importance.
As is often the case, the same
reason accounts for his being neglected
and for his later popularity, and that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
reason is the complete newness of his
outlook. His vision was a much stranger
and newer one than had been that of the
Impressionists, and yet but for a fortunate
failing of his own it might never have
been expressed at all. Cézanne was a
very great artist and a very bad painter.
One may go further and say that had he
not been such a bad painter he might
never have shown himself to be a great
artist. His whole being was clumsy and
blundering, and his attempts to emulate
the brilliant Manet in his light effects
were constantly balked by this very
clumsiness. In despair, he gave up the
task and lumped down what he saw,
and, being a great artist, he saw something
quite new.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> He saw line and
decorative grouping where Impressionism
saw only a shimmer of sunlight. His
tactless, outspoken nature is reproduced
in his paintings, be they still-life, figure-pieces,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
portraits, or landscapes. Mr.
Sickert, comparing his work with the
‘gentle painter-like art of Pissarro,’
describes his pictures as ‘ninety per cent.
monstrous, tragic failures,’ and from this
standpoint the statement seems just
enough.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> But ‘brilliant and sane efficiency’
is not the highest attribute in
an artist, and Cézanne by his genius
redeems and almost glorifies his clumsiness.
To landscape he gave structure
and rhythm. In his pictures of Ste.
Victoire, of steep fields and hillsides,
the strong architecture of the landscape
is the framework of the whole.</p>

<p>This originality of Cézanne has been
developed and perfected by an artist
working in England to-day, whose work
is more in sympathy with the moods
and structure of mountains than even
that of his great predecessor, and the
artist is Professor C. J. Holmes, whom
I have already quoted (see above).</p>

<p>Mr. Holmes is very modern, and he
is an Englishman; that is to say, he is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
part of a movement which has a deep
feeling for synthesis and the subtlety of
rhythm&mdash;and this is important with a
view to what has been said about the
synthetic nature of mountains&mdash;and also
he is a member of the race which has
always shown more understanding for
nature than any other in Europe or,
perhaps, in the world.</p>

<p>France, the leader in matters artistic,
has never had any real grasp of nature
since the days of Ronsard. The French
are too intelligent, too pitilessly logical,
to accept the moods of nature without
reasoning.</p>

<p>From such a generalisation one should,
perhaps, except Rousseau. Although
in much of his teaching it is difficult to
escape the idea that the nature he
preached has been touched up by civilisation,
in comparison with many of his
disciples he had a genuine desire to
escape the works of men. In his
political theory, in his morality, in his
conception of the beautiful, he turned
always to nature for his ideal. From his
home in Geneva he learnt to love the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
mountains, to love the great calm and
dignity of them, their aloofness from
man and his pettiness:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p xml:lang="fr">‘En effet, c’est une impression
générale qu’éprouvent tous les hommes
... que sur les hautes montagnes
... les plaisirs sont moins
ardents, les passions plus modérées.
Il semble qu’en s’élevant au-dessus
du séjour des hommes, on y laisse
tous les sentiments bas et terrestres.’<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p></blockquote>

<p>But even here one suspects that Rousseau
is rather contrasting the worries of a
race cursed with powers of emotion,
with the sublime peace of unfeeling
nature, than admitting the passion of the
hills, which differs only from that of
men in its loftiness and nobility. And
this last belief is not only held by the
England of to-day, but was a prominent
conviction of William Wordsworth’s,
and he lies behind the English fondness
for nature throughout the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>Of the group of great poets who make
up the English Romantic Revival, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
voiced during the first half of the nineteenth
century the ferment of new ideas,
the greatest is Wordsworth. Stirred, as
were the rest, by the teaching of Rousseau&mdash;and
it is here perhaps that Rousseau’s
chief importance lies&mdash;he expressed
in his poetry the aspirations which in
France found vent in an orgy of political
philosophy and the eager, endless search
for liberty. His poetry and his sister’s
journals foretell that art which was to
supersede maudlin subjectivism and, in
its turn, Parnassian coldness. Coleridge
may have more mystery, Shelley more
fire, Keats more music, but it was
Wordsworth who really felt the common
soul in nature, the fusion of the human
and the natural into one scale of moods
and longings. He realised that mountains
can hate, that they can resent intrusion,
as can human beings.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘I dipped my oars into the silent lake<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And, as I rose upon the stroke, my boat<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Went heaving through the water like a swan;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When, from behind that craggy steep till then<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The horizons bound, a huge peak, black and huge,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As if with voluntary power instinct<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Upreared its head. I struck and struck again,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Strode after me.’<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&mdash;which shows how mountains can be
understood even by man who was no
climber, who, indeed, made a point of
always walking round rather than over
any hill on his way. His belief is the
same with every aspect of nature. She
has her moods, and they are the same as
ours. We can realise them because of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘A motion and a spirit that impels<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All thinking things, all objects of all thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And rolls through all things.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Wordsworth’s power of expression, and
even more his power of selection, lag
far behind his power of feeling. But
what may detract from the pleasure of
actual perusal cannot lessen ultimate
historical importance. Modern art must
find in Wordsworth its greatest forerunner
in the department of nature.
From him, as has been hinted, springs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
the tendency which permeated French
literature at the end of last century.
The pantheist art of Symbolism which
came to influence England in the
nineties is, at bottom, a half-English
movement.</p>

<p>A love of nature, therefore, is in
Mr. Holmes’ blood, and with this great
tradition behind him he is working to
give mountains the artistic interpretation
which has so long been denied them.
In his pictures and drawings of the
English lakeland he has externalised an
aspect of mountain scenery which is
quite new. Some one has well expressed
it by saying that he paints mountains not
so much as they actually look but as one
remembers them to be; and this is the
same as saying that repudiation of illusion
or naturalism enables him to suggest the
‘mountainness’ of the mountain, the
vague, essential something which tells
one it is a mountain.</p>

<p>In his heritage from Cézanne, Mr.
Holmes has at any rate acquired no
clumsiness, but greater skill has not
tempted him to too much detail. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
has carried to still greater lengths synthesis
and simplification. In economy
of line he can hold his own with any
of the new school of painters. With a
few bold strokes he gives the massive
strength of hills and rocks. It is now
possible to realise how simple is the
structure of mountains, but at the same
time how clear must be the discrimination
between the essential and the superfluous.
By adopting the black border
with which many of the Fauves surround
the objects in their pictures, Mr. Holmes
is able to dispense with chiaroscuro&mdash;almost
with perspective. He paints in
flat washes of colour, admirably toned,
and separates one plane from another by
a band of black. The distance springs
into being, and perspective is achieved
without elaboration, without destruction
of essential outline.</p>

<p>Besides this ‘realism of effect’ as
opposed to ‘realism of fact,’ Mr. Holmes
has another definite aim, which attaches
his art still more closely to Fauvism.
He has a keen sense of the decorative
importance of a picture. He has said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
himself: ‘The first function of a picture
is architectural&mdash;it has to be a beautiful
part of the wall surface.’<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> This aim is
certainly fulfilled in his work. The lines
of the hills run in subtle rhythms, and
the whole lies gracefully on the wall and
becomes a part of it. As ever, Mr.
Holmes is his own best critic. He has
summed up this double ideal&mdash;synthesis
and decorative value&mdash;as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘At the very birth of art we find
the necessity of selection and omission,
with a view to emphatic
statement, recognised more generally
perhaps than it has ever been recognised
since. And with this
necessity we may note another characteristic
of primitive art&mdash;the love
of rhythm and pattern.’<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It has been seen that, with the exception
of Cézanne, Mr. Holmes has no
direct ancestor in European art. But,
nevertheless, he is the ready pupil of centuries.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
His art is not merely, as in the
case of several other prominent Fauves,
a slavish return to the primitive. It is
founded on a thorough knowledge of the
past. A further extract from his book<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
will show that he gives a modern expression
to centuries of ideals:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Painting succeeds in virtue of
the things it omits, almost as much
as by the assistance of the things
it expresses.... In Egyptian art
the figures might have been less
stiffly uniform, in Crete they sometimes
verge on caricature; in Byzantine
work they assume too
much the rigid character of architecture;
with the Italians of the
Irecento too much of the Byzantine
temper may survive; in China
forms may be contorted through the
connection of painting with calligraphy.
Yet with all their defects,
these various phases of painting
serve their destined purpose, and
serve it much better than the painting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
of more sophisticated ages has
succeeded in doing.... Contours
may be as nobly drawn as human
skill can draw them, but they must
be firm and definite throughout.
The colour may be as brilliant or as
quiet as circumstances demand, but
it must be applied in masses that are
flat or nearly flat. Details, forcible
suggestion of relief and strong
shadows must be avoided. In our
own day these limitations have been
observed and respected only by a
single painter&mdash;Puvis de Chavannes&mdash;but
in virtue of that restraint he
has taken his place among the great
masters.’</p></blockquote>

<p>And so the art of Mr. Holmes is a direct
practice of his preaching. To the tradition
of simplified vision he has brought
a conception of his own&mdash;the conception
of mountains, of their formation; and
their rhythm.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> Not Puvis de Chavannes,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
whom he has mentioned, nor Daumier,
whom perhaps he should have mentioned,
felt the character of landscape as deeply
as Mr. Holmes has done. In his elimination
he is not arbitrary, but natural
and very just. His mountains remain
synthetic, uncivilised, individual, as they
are in nature.</p>

<p>But besides his debt to the centuries
of European art, he is greatly helped by
his knowledge and love of the art of
China and Japan. Like so many modern
Europeans, he has been profoundly moved
by the marvellous achievements of Eastern
painting, but, beyond an admission
of general influence, no very clear artistic
lineage can be made out.</p>

<p>Mr. Binyon has traced the influence
of Hokusai in Mr. Holmes’ work,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> and
the suggestion seems justified. Mr.
Holmes has an avowed admiration for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
the work of the Japanese artist, and
apart from this, the folding lines of the
hills and the flat, green washes of his
water-colours show a distinct affinity.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘In Japanese painting form and
colour are represented without any
attempt at relief, but in European
methods relief and illusion are
sought for.’</p></blockquote>

<p>This is Hokusai himself, and Mr.
Holmes has profited by the comparison
to fuse both systems into one.</p>

<p>And so, while, in the matter of Eastern
as well as of Western art, his great store
of knowledge of the painting of the past
is the foundation of his genius, the genius
itself&mdash;the message and its expression&mdash;remains
his own.</p>

<p>Before closing it would be well to
mention one criticism which has been
levelled at Mr. Holmes, and which, if
it is true, constitutes a serious charge.
He has been accused of being scientific
to the point of having a formula on
which he works. Perhaps the title of
his book is partly responsible for the
accusation, and it might certainly have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
been better chosen. But beyond this no
trace of justification is visible. Order
and inspiration are not necessarily incompatible.
The extravagant lengths reached
by the æsthetic movement proved the
result of art ignoring science. Eccentricity
had become a fetish, and Mr.
Holmes is working with his fellow
Fauves to restore reason and sanity.
There is too much variety in his work to
allow of a suspicion of any formula. A
series of mountain studies naturally have
some affinity, and this affinity has been
exaggerated into a definite method. Such
a charge cannot be further disproved
than by assertion of its falsity. If that
is insufficient, let the unsatisfied critic
carefully study all Mr. Holmes’ work,
and draw a new conclusion. Continued
belief in the formula must stay uncombated;
but even should the charge be
generally accepted as true, the admiration
of one at least for Mr. Holmes and his
work will remain unshaken.

peak, an outlying spur of the Wetterhorn,

That was my first climb. I confess
that it was nothing very thrilling, though
I enjoyed it thoroughly. We had a

it. Among all this intolerable deal of
bread, however, we had a halfpenny
worth of something more intoxicating.
There is a long snow slope to be crossed
slantingly before the col and the hut are
reached. It is not at all steep, sloping
up to the lower border of the rock pile
that forms the pyramidal top of the
mountain; but the old guide had ordered
the rope, and so there we were plodding
diagonally upwards in single file.</p>

<p>All of a sudden there was a rattle, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
then a stone leapt off the rocks above to
bound down the snow slope some four
hundred yards ahead of us. The old
guide looked round, and said: ‘Chamois.’</p>

<p>This set us all agog&mdash;two or three
had never seen the chamois on his
native heath. However, the brown coat
of the chamois is a good piece of cryptic
colouring; he&mdash;or they&mdash;remained absolutely
invisible against the brown rocks.
But we had startled him, and he went
on moving&mdash;for some reason towards us,
as we soon discovered when a second
stone came down. The third alarmed
us a little, for it crossed our path not
fifty yards ahead of the leader; so we
resolved to halt and keep our eyes open
for the next. This was not long in
coming; it came with a bound off the
rocks, and seemed to be heading for the
gap between the last two on the rope.
It must have been going at a great pace,
for it devoured that snow slope in great
hungry leaps, clearing eighty or a hundred
feet at a bound, though never rising a
yard above the snow; it hummed as it
came, with a deep buzzing sound. Altogether
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
it was extremely alarming (I was
one of the two hindermost), and it was
a considerable relief to see, after it was
half-way to us, that it had a slight curl
on it, and an outward curl, which caused
it to hum past five or six yards behind
the tail of our procession. The chamois
passed, still invisible, on his way, and we
on ours, discussing what would have been
the best thing to do supposing his aim
had been straighter.</p>

<p>It was that scene that came into my
head years later. I had been trying to
master some of the rudiments of geology,
of which science I was lamentably
ignorant, and had at least begun to get
into my head the idea of denudation&mdash;how
the shapes of mountains as we see
them are as much due to cutting away
as to heaving up&mdash;and was grasping the
strength of the denuding forces that
would go on thus cutting and cutting
until nothing was left but one flat plain,
did they not thus once more liberate
the forces of upheaval. In my textbook
there were examples given of the
many and various activities working
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
together this work of destruction&mdash;wind
and sun, rain and frost, sand, rivers, little
plants&mdash;‘and chamois!’ came suddenly
into my mind. A little nail will serve
to hang a large picture; and so the
whole idea of denudation was fixed in
my brain by that one Bernese chamois.</p>

<p>It perhaps, more than any other single
thing, taught me to see the transience of
the hills. For here, as so often elsewhere,
the judgments of the natural man
must be unlearnt. ‘The hills stand about
Jerusalem,’ says the natural man,&mdash;‘The
Eternal Hills!’ They are not eternal;
they are as transitory, as much slaves of
Time, as anything with life. The title is
but one more witness to the arrogance,
the unimaginativeness of man, who thinks
that everything is of the same order of
magnitude as he himself; and if he does not
notice the hour hand move while he trips
along some fraction of the circumference
of the seconds dial&mdash;why, then, it must be
motionless!</p>

<p>But man possesses also a brain, and
therein an intelligence, a logical faculty,
by means of which he discovers presently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
that things are not always what they
seem; and one of these apparent contradictions
is that the mountains must be
changing, rising up and wearing down,
even though he cannot perceive it
directly; and yet even though he can
prove that it must be so, it is still very
difficult for him to realise it happening.</p>

<p>Our intelligence, indeed, although it
thus transcends the senses’ immediate
judgments, has to go back to them and
ask their aid if it is to attain to fullest
knowledge. It is a very imperfect instrument,
so built up on the foundations of
the five senses that if we cannot feel,
hear, taste, smell or, more particularly,
see what there is to be dealt with, but
only reason about it, we may <i>know</i> quite
well that reasoning has led to the only
right conclusion, but yet do not <i>feel</i> fully
and unquestioningly the rightness of it.
We all believe the moon to be a globe;
but I must confess that on my first sight of
her through a telescope, I experienced a
veritable shock of surprise and pleasure
to realise, as I saw the craters passing
from full face in the centre to profile at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
the edge, how globular she really was.
With the mountains no such ocular
demonstration is possible to us. I say
to us, for to our descendants it may be.
You have but to take a series of photographs
of some peak from exactly the
same spot at intervals of fifty years or
so; then, putting these together in their
order, run them through a cinematograph,
and you would see your everlasting
citadel crumble, shrinking before your
eyes like a pricked balloon. Such a
condensation of events has already been
practised to render such slow processes
as the growth of twigs or the complex
unfolding of the egg more patent and
striking; and there is no reason why it
should not be applied to matters of
centuries instead of days.</p>

<p>To-day we cannot have the change
rendered thus visible to us. We have
only indirect methods to help us, methods
which demand reflection and imagination.
Imagination and reflection, however,
are processes demanding more
mental energy than the average man is
willing to expend, for the average man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
is mentally of extreme laziness. So the
mountains remain eternal, to the average
man.</p>

<p>But there is no harm in trying to
exercise powers of reflection and of
imagination, if I may persuade you to
it. Stand on the bridges at Geneva and
look at the Rhone slipping down from
the lake, clear and blue with a wonderful
and almost unreal blue. Then walk
down to the junction of the Rhone and
the Arve, and see that other river,
turbid, greyish-white, a regular glacier
stream; identity and name may be taken
from it in the union, but it still has
strength to rob the robber of his own
especial beauty. That discolouring flood&mdash;what
is it? As you walk back again,
the top of Mont Blanc comes gradually
from behind the Grande Salève into sight.
If you reflect, you will know that those
white waves were white from carrying
away what only yesterday had been a
part of those famous mountains; to-day
it is dust, and nameless; to-morrow it
will be laid down upon the ocean floor,
there to be hardened, kneaded, and baked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
into the bricks that shall build other, as
yet unchristened, hills. If you imagine,
you will see in the mind’s eye those
same summits, thus continually attacked,
gradually shrinking; preserving their
beauty to the last, no doubt, like our
lovely lake mountains, which though in
respect of their former height they be
but as roots when the trunk is fallen, yet
in themselves show not a trace of decay,
and lift their heads as strong and fresh as
ever. Yet they dwindle, and will in the
end be mountains no more; they will
no more have form and shape, no more
be named and almost live, endowed with
that strong appearance of vivid and
obvious personality; mere undulations,
they will no more exercise the mountain
power upon the mind of man.</p>

<p>What else will help you to see the
transience of the hills? Go and stand
by a mountain stream where it runs in
quick swishing rapids; as I have done
by the Drance de Bagnes, and heard
sounds as of groaning and muffled giant
hammering&mdash;great boulders grinding each
other in the press of the current, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
moving always downwards. Go and
look at the enormous moraines that wind
down into Italy&mdash;each would be a range
of hills in England. Had not the Alps
another aspect before these were heaped
up? And yet, say the geologists, great
cenotaphs of the ice were raised in but
a fraction of the time since the Alps
were born. Try to tackle a rock-and-ice
gully with strong sun on it, or
(preferably) stay on one side and watch
the stones come down: down they come
like that every sunny day.</p>

<p>Look at the Matterhorn, and be told
how like it is to Strasburg Cathedral;
but rock spires are not built upwards
like ones of stone and mortar; they are
monoliths, cut out of the solid rock.
The stony layers of the rock, once
lying flat and soft upon the sea-bottom,
then hardened, then gripped and crumpled
by the ageing earth like so many sheets
of wet paper, now are cut through, and
show their free edges on the steep flanks
of the mountain. Fixed long ago in
waves and curves, now they are immobile,
but they treasure within themselves the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
forms which the ice and the sun are to
reveal. As if the sculptor were to have
but half the shaping of his work, and
the block of marble almost of itself disclose
its hidden Oenus, or turn a Hercules
planned into a Hylas accomplished, so
the rock masses contain within themselves
no infinite possibility of forms&mdash;there
is, to start with, a quality of
mountain concealed in the rock, so that
the aerial sculptors may work as they
please, and never find a Dent du Midi
in the Mont Blanc range, or fashion a
Weisshorn from the Dolomites. But
that is another story. Even though the
rocks thus decree that the instruments
of their destruction shall be as well instruments
to reveal their hidden beauties,
yet destruction none the less it is. How
gigantic a destruction those cut, upcurving
layers of rock can testify.</p>

<p>But in the same way as our mind can
know and yet not feel the mutability of
the mountains, so it may know and yet
not grasp their size and its extent. Here
again the new lesson is hard to be learnt
by brain alone: ‘Everest 29,002, Mont
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
Blanc 15,786, Scawfell Pike 3210’&mdash;the
figures convey but a part. The hills
must take the mind by assault through
the breaches of sense.</p>

<p>Those moments come but rarely. I
have seen the west face of Skiddaw
once, and once Schiehallion from the
Struan road, towering as high as any
Alpine peak might do; and Donkin’s
famous photograph of the Weisshorn
gives one something of the true feeling.
But the most complete revelation came
to me at the head of the Swiss Val
Ferret.</p>

<p>We had already begun to appreciate
the bigness of things, but rather through
our own littleness than for any unusual
grandeur revealed in them. As you walk
up the deep, close valley, you have on your
right, in contrast to the monotonous dry
ridge of even middle height to the left,
a succession of broad bluffs or buttresses
that sustain the east end and guard the
eastern glacier gateways of that great
Cathedral of Three Nations, the massif
of Mont Blanc. There is one below and
one above the end of the Saleinaz glacier,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
and on the side of each a lesser bluff, an
inward, forward-projecting pillar that
narrows the gateway to a mere postern,
with only glimpses of the broad aisle
above. Both these doorposts bear the
same name&mdash;Tita Moutse or Tête
Moutze; a very good name, certainly,
but you would think that the dwellers
at Proz-de-Fort, just between the two,
might find it confusing, even though on
Barbier’s map one is printed black and
upright, the other thin and in italics.
It is difficult to render these distinctions
in speaking&mdash;and perhaps they have not
all got Barbier’s map. However, that is
not our concern at present. Farther up
is another big buttress (rejoicing in the
name of Treutze Bouc), and another,
and then the Glacier de la Neuvaz, with
the Châlet Ferret on the other hand,
and feather beds for weary travellers.</p>

<p>These buttresses, and especially the
Treutze Bouc, are calculated to annoy
the walker. There they stand, looking
no bigger than a buttress of Snowdon
or Saddleback; there as here the mountain
torrents cut away the ground in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
the same way, and the same broad-faced
bluffs are left. As with bluffs, so with
ships: it is almost impossible to grasp
the size of a big liner out at sea, her
build is the same as that of any other
steamship, and there is no standard of
comparison. Here in the Val Ferret
one learns by bitter experience and
blistered feet. The road winds on and
on, across torrent-beds, through alder-woods,
along hot slopes&mdash;and the summit
of Treutze Bouc is not yet opposite.
After this lengthy demonstration of the
disadvantages and unpleasantnesses of
size, the mountains at last relent and
show the other side of the picture.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the impression of
colossal grandeur that showed itself at
a turn of the road opposite the gate of
the Glacier de la Neuvaz. Nothing was
lacking in the chain. In the foreground,
below a grassy bank, flowed the Drance
de Ferret&mdash;only a smallish stream, but
big enough and swift enough unbridged
to stop such a small animal as man from
gaining its other side. Across it lay a
fallen pine; and from this, better than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
from the standing trees, you realised to
what a height the pine-trunks grow.
Of these there was a thick wood filling
up the level bottom left by the receding
glacier; the green sea extended back
and back until the tops of the separate
trees were not to be made out, and the
whole wood tapered away in perspective
like a band of clouds towards the setting
sun. In the end it turned a corner to
the right&mdash;a thin green line beyond the
grey terminal moraine. This corner
filled a little indentation in the hill
behind. The eye travelled up naturally
from the green line of trees to the green
slope, and saw that slope as part of a
great rounded hill, rather like a bit of
the Downs in general appearance; but
had it been hollow you could have gone
on pouring your Chanctonburies and
Sinoduns and Beachy Heads and Hogs
backs into it, and they would have rattled
about like small-shot inside. The stream
of trees let you see how big it was,
as hills on the horizon show the greatness
of the setting moon. I think the
hill was nameless. Beyond it, in another
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
plane of distance, rose another peak&mdash;this
one brown, of bare rock, and rather
jagged; the vegetation had ended on
the part concealed behind the green hill.
Up and up the eye travelled, and was
amazed to find that if the green had
been but a spur of the brown, so the
brown was but a spur of the white.
Mont Dolent arose from, behind it like
the pursuing peak in the <i>Prelude</i>. All
its rocky middle and its snowline were
in their turn hidden by the brown spur
before them; only the white slanting
chisel edge of the summit soared up to
sight. Stream&mdash;tree&mdash;wood&mdash;mountains:
one, two, and three ... each
formed a stepping-stone to the one beyond,
making it possible for the whole
grandeur of the peak to slip down, as it
were, and find place within the narrow
limits of the brain waiting at the other
end.</p>

<p>There it was able to take up its station
beside that other thought which entered
there, not charioted by Bacchus and his
pards, but by the swift chamois and the
mountain torrents. The two, holding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
mutual colloquy, together tell what
Wordsworth learnt in another fashion,
that the mountains are</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Huge and mighty forms, that do not live<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like living men.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But live they do, in their own way&mdash;not
only in their form and individuality,
but in the constant cycle of their changeableness.
They approach to being closed
systems, independent in some degree
of the rest of the world; partial individuals,
they have a share in determining
their future selves. Once raised to
mountains, they contain within themselves
the germs of their own destiny;
and if not possessing such power as true
life possesses of blossoming into a predetermined
form, scarcely to be altered
by all the efforts of the outside world,
yet at least marking down beforehand
the limits beyond which the outer
influences cannot mould them, preordaining
the main succession of their
future history, and the essential quality
of the forms they are to take. And
again, though they have not the true
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
vital property of reproducing their kind
by means of a mere particle of their
own substance, that grows, and in its
growth takes up the atoms of outer
matter and moulds them to its will, they
have a kind of reproduction scarcely less
strange, where like generates not like, but
unlike. In their decay they are laying
new foundations. Grain torn from grain
of solid rock, boulder from boulder is
swept away; layer after layer of grains
or boulder is laid&mdash;‘well and truly laid’;
rock system piled upon rock system; till
the time comes, and all this is upheaved
into a chain of peaks which, though their
every particle were taken from the substance
of that older chain, will be like it
in being a mountain range, but in that
alone. So they have their being, in a
different and vaster cycle than man’s,
their life only another fragment of that
change which is the single fixed reality.</p>

<p>And what is the moral of all this?
You may well ask; for I do not know
that I know myself. Proceed to the fact
that our mountains are but crinkles on
the rind of a small satellite of one star
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
among the millions, and we deduce the
littleness of man: which has been done
before. Point out how, in spite of all
their size and their terrors, they fall one
by one to the climber, and we with
equal facility prove his greatness: which
also others have successfully attempted.
Insist on their mutability, and it merely
takes us back to Heraclitus and his <span xml:lang="el">πάντα
ῥεῖ.</span> Perhaps one moral is that feeling
as well as reasoning, reasoning as well
as feeling, is necessary to true knowledge;
a conclusion which would appeal to
followers of M. Bergson, but hardly falls
within the scope of this book.</p>

<p>The chief moral is, I expect, that the
mountains can give the climber more
than climbing, and will do so if he but
keep his eyes open. From them there
will come to him flashes of beauty and
of grandeur, light in dark places, sudden
glimpses of the age, the glory, and the
greatness of the earth.

GREEK POETRY</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Before</span> we try to discover from
their literature the feelings of the
Greeks for the mountains, we should
first trace clearly the origin of our own
attitude towards high places.</p>

<p>Nature-worship is a reaction from the
life of crowded communities; contrast
and change are the essentials of rest. It is
only for those whose life is passed in great
cities fully to appreciate the mountains;
in their own country the hills have no
honour, for where men make their living
they cannot appreciate life. But we are
so much accustomed to accept as absolute
our personal standard of beauty, made up
of all those things which seem to us
beautiful on account of their contrast to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
our ordinary surroundings, that it is hard
to realise the fact that all expressions of
beauty depend upon individual perception,
and are therefore relative. A converse
often illuminates the less obvious
side of a question, and the converse of
our love for the mountains is strikingly
shown by Sir Leslie Stephen, who records
that a highly intelligent Swiss guide
pronounced the dreary expanse of
chimney-pots round the South-Western
Railway finer than the view from the
top of Mont Blanc. It was a contrast
to his ordinary life, and therefore, for
him, beautiful. For to the guide, <i>qua</i>
guide, a mountain is not a form of the
Idea of Beauty, but a problem in higher
mathematics, each possible route an indeterminate
equation in terms of glacier,
rock, ice, and snow; and the great guide
is he who can solve most truly in theory
and in practice the daily variations of
these and other unknown quantities. A
mountain to him may be like a great
book made odious by being set as a
holiday task.</p>

<p>But the guide is hardly a fair example,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
since he is the product of an artificial
demand: let us take, as a less extreme
case, the more primitive inhabitants of
a mountainous land, whose living comes
from the land itself, not indirectly from
the great cities through services rendered
to their holiday-makers. The peasants
of such a country must work the land
for their living, not look at it; life
comes before æstheticism, and the artistic
temperament is an inadequate remedy
for an empty stomach. To such men
the mountains do not represent beauty
and strength and freedom, but an amazing
waste of the surface of the earth, useless
deserts, from which every acre of lowland
and slope must be redeemed for crops
and vineyards.</p>

<p>It was in this light that the Greeks
saw their mountains. In their eyes they
compared very unfavourably with their
great natural rival, the sea. It is true
that the sea was mildly reproved by the
epithet ἀτρυγετός for producing no crops,
but it made amends, being the good-natured
Mediterranean, by helping to
transport the produce of other lands,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
while the mountains were a positive
obstacle to commerce.</p>

<p>We may note that in Il. i. 156:&mdash;</p>

<div xml:lang="el" class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">ἦ μάλα πολλὰ μεταξὺ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">οὔρεά τε σκιόεντα θάλασσά τε ἠχήεσσα,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the mountains and the sea are both alike
mentioned as barriers between people and
people, although it may be questioned
whether the idea is more definite than
that of distance, to which the epithet
σκιόεντα is more appropriate. In this
case the mountains are introduced merely
to give a concrete horizon to the idea of
remoteness conveyed by <span xml:lang="el">μάλα πολλά</span> and
<span xml:lang="el">σκιόεντα.</span></p>

<p>The sea was commonly regarded by
the Greeks as a tie between land and
land, the mountains as a barrier. So
they damned the mountains with faint
praise of their timber, their hunting
grounds, and, most unkindest cut, the
wider view of the sea from their cliffs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
There was no one to tell the primitive
Greeks that from the hated mountains,
by streams and melting snows, came the
very meadows in which they delighted,
that the richness of their ideal pasture-lands
of Thessaly was produced, not in
spite of, but actually by the mountains
round. So they continued to regard
them as heaps of waste, and it was this
view which was primarily responsible for
the reticence about the mountains with
which we meet in Greek literature. In
all the Odyssey there are hardly twenty
lines descriptive of the mountains. In
one of the most beautiful lines of
Homer:&mdash;</p>

<div xml:lang="el" class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">εἴσατο δ’ ὡς ὅτε ῥινὸν ἐν ἠεροειδέϊ πόντῳ.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a><br /></span>
<span class="author"><i>Od.</i> v. 281.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the picture is of the island, not of its
mountains; they are mentioned, but
merely because a low-lying island is not
visible in ‘misty’ distance.</p>

<p>The first use of the mountains in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
simile is to represent big, ugly people:
of the Cyclops,</p>

<div xml:lang="el" class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>For the most part, the mountains are
treated with contemptuous indifference.
It is evident that, as a place of outlook
over low-lying scenery or the sea, a
height of some sort is necessary, and
where such an outlook is mentioned by
Homer he does not grudge it an epithet;
but in such a passage as the following
the hill is nothing, the view from it all-important:&mdash;

<p>There is only one passage in Homer

another. Poseidon is watching the battle

<p>If we analyse our own pleasure in the
ascent of a mountain, giving due importance
to the view of other peaks from
it, we shall realise how significant it is
that this reference is unique in Homer.</p>

<p>Of rock-climbers Homer had a very
poor opinion: he would be a very bold
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
man now who would say of any rock
peak in the world:&mdash;</p>

<p>Baedeker himself could not more
vehemently warn of a novice from a
dangerous face; but there was little
chance that the climb in question would
ever become ‘an easy day for a lady,’ as
it led past the cave of Scylla, whose six
heads would have required a toll likely
to leave an appreciable gap in the largest

<p>But to the Greeks rocky cliffs appeared

<p>If Homer is disappointing, Hesiod is
far more so. If anywhere in Greek
literature we should expect some recognition
of the grandeur of the mountains,
it is undoubtedly in descriptions of their
birth. A poet could hardly hope to find
a more Titanic subject than that mighty
travailing of the Earth; but this is all
Hesiod finds to say:&mdash;</p>

<div xml:lang="el" class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">γείνατο δ’ Οὔρεα μακρά, θεῶν χαρίεντας ἐναύλους,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Νυμφέων, αἳ ναίουσιν ἀν’ οὔρεα βησσήεντα.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a><br /></span>
<span class="author"><i>Theogony</i>, 129.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>‘Long’ of all mountain epithets! ‘Graceful’
is insult added to injury! We must
suppose that Hesiod would have preferred
Amicombe Hill to Great Mis Tor, the
curves of the Downs to the towers of the
Dolomites.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that the Nymphs
should have stuck in the throat of certain
commentators, who propose to expunge
the second line. Certainly a real mountain
is the least suitable habitation for a
Nymph, and it is a pity that no artistic
member of the Alpine Club could have
been present to astonish Hesiod with a
lightning sketch of large troups of
Nymphs&mdash;in the days when Jaeger was
unknown, and furs still clothed their
natural owners&mdash;shivering like angels on
the needle-point of the Charmoz or on
the more appropriate summit of the
Jungfrau. There is one possible explanation,
hinted at in the Clouds of Aristophanes,
namely, that the Oceanids were
identified with clouds; but this is probably
a later rationalist theory, which would
have astonished the early poets themselves.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<p>There is not one line in Hesiod which
shows a real appreciation of the mountains:
some few allusions to Olympus
are the nearest approach to enthusiasm,
but the seat of the gods also proves a
broken reed to those who would portray
the Greeks as mountain-lovers. It was
necessary that the gods should be able to
look down on the earth, yet the anthropomorphic
tendencies of the age subjected
them to the same disadvantage as modern
aviators, namely, inability to remain
motionless in the air. It therefore
became necessary for them to take
possession of the highest fixed support,
Olympus.</p>

<p>Olympus is a real mountain, but for
the benefit of its divine tenants, more
especially perhaps of the goddesses, the
poets idealised it almost out of recognition.
We have Homer’s description of
the summit:&mdash;</p>

<div xml:lang="el" class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">[Οὔλυμπος] ὅθι φασὶ θεῶν ἕδος ἀσφαλὲς αἰεὶ<br /></span>

<span class="author"><i>Od.</i> vi. 42.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This process of describing an ideal and
then locating it in a definite accessible
spot has many parallels, though few in
which access and its consequent disillusionment
were so easy; we may compare
Atlantis, Avernus, King Arthur’s Cave on
Lliwedd, and the superstition which
was not uncommon a few years ago, that
a subtropical Paradise would be found beyond
the outer ice of the Arctic Circle.</p>

<p>Another passage, quoted from Lucian
in a paper by Mr. Douglas Freshfield,
on ‘Mountains and Mankind,’<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> as
showing that the Greeks loved their
mountains, is not altogether convincing:
Hermes takes Charon, when he has a
day out from Hell, to the twin-crested
summit, and shows him the panorama
of land and sea, of rivers and famous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
cities. The first impulse is to reject this
allusion as proving, not Lucian’s love
for the mountains, but his excellent taste
in contrast, for the holiday of the
dweller below the earth should rightly
be spent in its high places. This is
true as far as it goes, but apart from
the personal tastes of Lucian, to which
we have no more guide in his works
than to those of Shakespeare or any
other true dramatist, we must admit that
he here gives us the nearest parallel to
those conditions from which we escape
to the contrast of the mountains. London
duties, it is true, compare favourably
with those of Charon, but our reward
in escaping from them is greater, just
in so far as the Alps are greater than
Parnassus. The principle and the scale
of contrast are the same: this passage
would therefore seem to be nearer akin
to our modern mountain-worship than
might at first appear. But here again
it may be claimed that the mountain
is not made of much account except as
the means of obtaining a wider view of
the more fashionable beauties of nature.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

<p>Professor Palgrave asserts that the
dramatists seldom show appreciation of
scenery, but we must add to his exceptions
Euripides’ description of the sunrise
glow on the mountains:&mdash;</p>

<div xml:lang="el" class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Παρνησιάδες δ’ ἄβατοι κορυφαὶ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">καταλαμπόμεναι τὴν ἡμερίαν<br /></span>

<span class="author">Eur. <i>Ion.</i> 87.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>An excellent test of the impression
made on the Greek mind by any class
of natural phenomenon is to observe to
what extent representatives of that class
have been personified; if we apply this
test to the case of the mountains, we
shall be amazed at the Greek disregard
for them. When in the case of so
abstract a conception as that of time
we find personification, not only of the
idea as a whole, but also of its sub-divisions
<span xml:lang="el">(Ὧραι),</span> we may naturally
expect, not only a great Personal representative
of mountains in general, as
Poseidon represented the sea, but also
particular personifications of great peaks
or ranges, which in our eyes have at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
least as marked an individuality as rivers
or winds.</p>

<p>Yet, with the single exception of
Atlas, no mountain in Greek literature
has been represented as an animate
being. It is possible that Tennyson had
some precedent for his ‘Mother’ Ida;
<span xml:lang="el">μητέρα θήρων</span><a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> is the Homeric phrase.
Certainly a close connection exists between
Taÿgetus and Taÿgete, daughter
of Atlas, and there is some suggestion
of malevolent personality in the inhospitable
behaviour of the ‘Wandering
Rocks.’ But these are ill-defined and
isolated instances, which, even if numbered
by scores, instead of by scattered
units, would not materially affect the
argument.</p>

<p>About Atlas we have many different
stories. In the earliest account he is
one of the older family of gods, father
of Calypso, <span xml:lang="el">ὀλοόφρων,</span><a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> wizard Atlas,
knowing the depths of every sea; and to
him are entrusted the pillars which keep
heaven and earth apart.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span></p>

<p>According to Hesiod, he was the son of
the Titan Iapetus, and brother of Menœtius,
Prometheus, and Epimetheus, all of
whom incurred the anger of Zeus&mdash;Prometheus
and Menœtius for active hostility to
him, Epimetheus and Atlas apparently
for no more personal reason than that
their father was one of the hated Titans:
for this offence Atlas was punished by
the task of holding up the whole weight
of heaven on his shoulders. It does not
seem to have occurred to the early
writers that the extreme edge of an
inverted hemisphere is a most unsymmetrical
position for the sole supporter
of its weight.</p>

<p>The mountain, Atlas, was evidently
the Peak of Teneriffe,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> of which the
Phœnicians may well have brought a
description to Greece. It was afterwards
supposed to be in North Africa, and in
consequence dwindled to a comparatively
insignificant range containing no conspicuous
peak. The Titanid and the
mountain were ingeniously connected in
later times by the introduction of Perseus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
with the head of Medusa, which he
showed to Atlas at his own request, thus
turning him to stone.</p>

<p>A variation of this story marks an
intermediate stage towards the rationalisation
of the myth: in it Atlas is represented
as a king who refuses to show
hospitality to Perseus on account of a
prophecy of danger to himself from a son
of Zeus; he is turned into stone by the
same means, but as a punishment for his
churlishness.</p>

<p>The completely rationalised version
represents him as a king in the far West,
skilled in astronomy, and the inventor
of the globe. This story may have had
its origin in Homer’s ‘wizard’ Atlas,
and was probably connected with the far
older myths of Atlantis and the Garden
of the Hesperides.</p>

<p>It is evident that we have to thank
the Phœnicians for bringing one great
mountain so prominently before the
Greeks that alone of all mountains in
their literature it is endued with personality.
But it is lamentable to observe
how the affairs of Atlas, once released
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
from Phœnician control, descend into
the bourgeois rut of semi-divine nonentity.
He proceeded to marry a nymph,
who bore him seven other nymphs,
of whom Maia, mother of Hermes,
is alone conspicuous. These nymphs
lived together on Mount Cyllene until
forced to fly from Orion, whom they
escaped by the conventional stage-device
of metamorphosis, becoming first doves
(<span xml:lang="el">πελείαδες</span>) and then the constellation
of the Pleiades.</p>

<p>Mr. Bury<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> traces a connection between
the epithet ὀρειᾶν as applied to
the Pleiades and the name <span xml:lang="el">Ὠαρίων</span>, translating</p>

<div xml:lang="el" class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">ἐστι δ’ ἐοικὸς<br /></span>
<span class="i3">ὀρειᾶν γε Πελειάδων<br /></span>
<span class="i0">μὴ τήλοθεν Ὠαρίων’ ἀνεῖσθαι.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>by ‘It is meet that the rising of the
Mountain Hunter should not be far from
the Mountain Pleiades.’ This would be
unique among Greek references to the
mountains if the remotest etymological
connection could be traced between
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
<span xml:lang="el">Ὠαρίων</span> and <span xml:lang="el">ὄρος</span>; but this is rather a
B in ‘Both’ derivation, and it may be
mentioned for what it is worth that the
name Orion is otherwise explained for us
by Ovid.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>One alone of the Pleiad nymphs is
justified, to a follower of Mr. Bury, in
her mountain abode. If we accept
<span xml:lang="el">Ἀλκυόνη</span> as a personification of <span xml:lang="el">ἄλκη</span>,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>
we must certainly allow her to enthrone
herself on the highest peaks of
the ancient world, provided, of course,
that she was not so presumptuous as to
sit on her father.</p>

<p>It is clear, therefore, that the Greeks
owed the introduction of the mountain
into the Titan story to the Phœnicians’
description of Teneriffe, and that they
elaborated the myth with very little
regard for geography and none at all for
consistency. In spite of Mr. Bury’s
gallant salvage work, we must confess
that the mountain element is lost from
the story as soon as it is left in the hands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
of the Greeks, who treat it as a hen
treats the duckling she has hatched: an
adaptable duckling, for as a metamorphosis
story it has made a very good
chicken, though in the process it shames
its proper parents.</p>

<p>In Theocritus we find an exception to
the absence of mountain personification
in Menalkas’ <span xml:lang="el">Αἴτνα, μᾶτερ ἔμα</span>,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> but it
stands alone: the Cyclops, who was
quite as much the child of Ætna, seems
to regard the mountain merely as an ice-box
providing him with cool water:&mdash;</p>

<div xml:lang="el" class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">ψυχρὸν ὕδωρ, τό μοι ἁ πολυδένδρεος Αἴτνα<br /></span>
<span class="i0">λευκᾶς ἐκ χίονος πότον ἀμβρόσιον προίητι.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It would be hard, in speaking of the
snows of a mountain, to find a less
appropriate epithet than <span xml:lang="el">πολυδένδρεος.</span></p>

<p>There is little else in Theocritus about
the mountains except that Daphnis</p>

<div xml:lang="el" class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">χιὼν ὥς τις κατετάκετο μακρὸν ὑφ’ Αἷμον.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">ἢ Ἄθω ἢ Ῥοδόπαν ἢ Καύκασον ἐσχατόωντα.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

<p>If we compare Pindar’s descriptions of
the mountains with those of any other
Greek poet, it is not hard to make
ourselves believe that he knew something
of their secrets. But as soon as we set
these passages side by side with the rest
of his own work, we see them sink back
into insignificance. He wrote four or
five great mountain lines, but for each
of these he wrote ten for the valleys,
fifty for the stars, a hundred for the
sea.</p>

<p>Still, we cannot often find a mountain
honoured in Greek with such an epithet
as <span xml:lang="el">ὑψιμέδων</span>,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> usually applied to Zeus
alone; and Pindar also makes the first
mention of the ‘age’ of the hills:&mdash;</p>

<div xml:lang="el" class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Φλιοῦντος ὑπ’ ὠγυγίοις ὄρεσι.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is not clear why a hill should in
general be considered older than a plain:
they are said to have emerged from the
Deluge within quite a short time of each
other. But it would be pedantic to
summon scientists and insist on accuracy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
at the cost of such hoary phrases as ‘the
eternal hills,’ which are still the delight
of those pessimists who habitually allude
to mankind as <span xml:lang="el">ἐφημέριδες</span>.</p>

<p>Among Pindar’s descriptive phrases we
may notice <span xml:lang="el">ἔμβολον Ἀσίας</span>, of the headland
of Caria. The word, to a Greek, could
not but suggest its naval use, the ‘prow’
of Asia riding unmoved upon the waves.</p>

<p>Actual references to mountaineering
are so rare that we are tempted to find
an exception in</p>

<div xml:lang="el" class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">καὶ πάγον<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Κρόνου προσεφθέγξατο· πρόσθε γὰρ<br /></span>

<span class="i0">νιφάδι<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>by supposing it to be the only surviving
record of a first ascent by the Theban
Heracles, who claimed in consequence
the right to name the summit ascended.
Paley would add to the dangers and credit
of the expedition by finding in ‘<span xml:lang="el">βρέχετο
πολλᾷ νιφάδι</span>’ ‘a curious and noteworthy
tradition of a glacial or post-glacial
period!’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p>

<p>But all other mountain scenes in
Pindar, whether adorned with glaciers
or not, pale before the description of the
eruption of Ætna:&mdash;</p>

<div xml:lang="el" class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="author">Pind. <i>Pyth.</i> i. 15.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We need not enjoy this description
any the less for feeling that Pindar is
not thinking of Ætna the mountain, nor
even of Ætna the volcano, but only of
the eruption, which is not in his eyes
an eruption of Ætna but of the monstrous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
breath of Typhoeus. The mountain
is dismissed with little more than
the usual trite epithets&mdash;<span xml:lang="el">κίων οὐρανία,
νιφοέσσα, πάνετες χιόνος ὀξείας τιθήνα</span>,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> of
which the last phrase conveys an even
more false suggestion than the similar
<span xml:lang="el">χιονοτρόφος κιθαίρων</span>.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>Although references to the mountains
are even more rare in drama, this particular
eruption is ‘foretold’ by Prometheus:&mdash;</p>

<div xml:lang="el" class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">ἐκραγήσονταί ποτε<br /></span>

<p>Here Ætna has neither part nor lot in
the eruption: Typhoeus is made responsible
for the whole, in spite of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
fact that he has already been reduced
to ashes.</p>

<p>The mountains which form the setting
of the Prometheus Vinctus are regarded
solely as a bleak, inhospitable, and, above
all, inhuman, background for the sufferings
of the Titan. It is amazing to us
that when he is left alone and calls upon
the forms of nature around, only the
mountains have no place in the circle of
silent witnesses to whom he cries:&mdash;</p>

sources of the rivers, the multitudinous
laughter of the distant sea, Earth, the
Mother of All, and the all-seeing orb of
the Sun&mdash;all these are to look upon his
torments; but the mountains are degraded
by their omission below the very
springs which rise upon them.</p>

<p>It may be suggested, as an explanation,
that motion formed an essential part of
the Greek idea of beauty; for motion is
the outward and visible sign of life.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
We may observe that the words <span xml:lang="el">δῖος
αἴθηρ</span> make the air for a moment the
medium of thought, expressed in which
‘wind’ is the pure and abstract idea of
motion.</p>

<p>Prometheus, then, calls for sympathy
there alone where motion (or, in the case
of Earth, motherhood) gives promise of
life and sympathy.</p>

<p>It is interesting, in view of the fact
that brightness was also an element in
the Greek conception of beauty, to notice
that no phase of the sea so combines
these two qualities of brightness and
motion as its ‘multitudinous laughter.’
The path of gold of the rising sun may
be brighter, a storm more swift in motion,
but the perfect combination of the two
ideals is here described.</p>

<p>It is natural that brightness or light
should be held in such honour, but it is
more surprising that beauty should be
associated with motion in many cases
in which the connection seems to us
extremely remote.</p>

<p>The winds are the most conspicuous
case of this: the Greeks personified more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
winds than they could name points
of the compass, and Greek poetry is
almost as full of the winds as of the
sea.</p>

<p>This is especially marked in the Iliad,
where anything which shows the movement
of the wind, whether snow, the
sea, a cornfield, mist, or clouds, is
described again and again, while still
air is only mentioned in a few scattered
passages.</p>

<p>In one of these snow is described
falling through a calm<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> to represent the
same showers of stones which had just
been compared to snow driven by a
tempest; so it is evident that no importance
attaches to the calmness, but both
passages convey the sense of motion,
though in a slightly different degree.</p>

<p>In another very remarkable passage
Homer makes use of stationary clouds
round a mountain-top as a type of steadfastness:&mdash;</p>

<div xml:lang="el" class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">ἀλλ’ ἔμενον νεφέλῃσιν ἐοικότες, ἅς τε Κρονίων<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>But for the most part the mists and
the clouds, and even the sea, must be
stirred to motion by the wind before they
are considered worthy of a Greek poet’s
attention.</p>

<p>The allusions to the wind-stirred sea
are innumerable; the eddies of war are
often compared to a whirlwind; the
misty clouds are broken apart by the wind
to reveal, now the dark waves of the sea,
now the black peaks of a mountain:&mdash;</p>

<div xml:lang="el" class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">ὡς δ’ ὅτ’ ἀφ’ ὑψηλῆς κορυφῆς ὄρεος μεγάλοιο<br /></span>

<span class="author"><i>Il.</i> xvi. 297.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<p>But here the unmoved rock is merely
a background of darkness, in contrast to
the light of the clouds, as in the
Prometheus it is a background of stillness
to the motion of the drama.</p>

<p>We have also, in the theory that
motion was essentially connected with
the ancient ideal of beauty, some explanation
of the fact that rounded heights,
clothed with leafy woods where the wind
could</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i22">‘fling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their placid green to silver of delight.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>seemed more beautiful to the Greeks than
scarps of naked rock; and it is natural
that the poets of such an ideal, superficial
though it may seem to us, should
pass by the silent majesty of Ætna with
careless customary epithets until the fires
within burst their bounds and poured
ostentatiously to the sea in ‘eddies of
blood-red flame.’</p>

<p>It would seem that the Greeks felt fear
and awe alone of the great mountains,
as was natural; for they had no intimate
knowledge of them, nor ever sought in
the mountains the emotions reserved for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
those who match their strength against
the great forces of nature. These
sensations, in the Greek, were inspired
by the sea. But for us the spell of
the mountains has grown stronger than
that of the waves, for the days are gone
in which the sea alone was the home of
peril and mystery. We follow the spirit
of the Greeks, not the letter of their
song; for though they sang of the sea,
it was of her freedom and strength, of
her secrets and dangers, and of these
much has passed from her. Though we
may still cross the seas on which the
<i>Argo</i> sailed, the greater part of their
romance is dead, and the Admiralty charts
are its epitaph. Scylla and Charybdis
are mapped; there is, for the vandal to
read, a latitude and a longitude of Tyre.</p>

<p>We have still with us the seas of
romance, of the Sagas, of the Odyssey,
of the Ancient Mariner; we may still
look from</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Magic casements, opening on the foam<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of perilous seas, in faëry lands forlorn.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But these are armchair adventures, fireside
voyages: these we must share with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
the cripple and the old. We who are
young may find in the mountains new
worlds of adventure and romance of
which the Greeks knew nothing; but
though the beauties, the perils, the
rewards are changed, the spirit is the
same. No sea hero of the Greeks would
be long a stranger among mountaineers:
where now but in the mountains should
Odysseus wander, <span xml:lang="el">πολύτλας, πολύμητις</span>, first
in every quest of perilous glory, crowning
the hopes of long years of wanderers?</p>

<p>Our mountain-worship is then no new
creed, nor artificial dogma, but a new
epiphany of the spirit of Hellas; and
the spirit will be the same, even though
the men of later ages find their romance
beneath the seas whereon the Greeks
sought it, or above the mountains in
which our quest is set.

<h2 id="IV_A_JOURNEY">IV. A JOURNEY</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Every</span> right-minded reader loves a
few books in defiance of his own
critical canons. One cannot be for
ever brooding over the best that is known
and thought in the world. Such an uncanonical
book to me is Ouida’s <i>Moths</i>. It
was in Dresden, towards the end of May
1908, that I read it for the first time.
Summer was in the air, a German summer
of blue skies and lazy white clouds drifting
to the south. In April, when I arrived,
I liked Dresden well enough, was prepared
to stop there quietly till October,
learning German. But as the cold
weather passed, each day left me more
restless, cramped by the monotonous,
speckless streets, irked by a vision of
the summer Alps, a shining mountain
wall beyond the southern horizon. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
spirit of romance was upon me, that
heedless of realistic truth invests with
ideal charm whatever is far off. To
such a mood Ouida appealed strongly.
For she was perhaps the last of those
romantics who created out of the dust
and dreariness of eighteenth-century
Europe a fairyland of beauty. Germany
to her was still the mystic land, dreaming
of the Middle Ages; Italy still
Mignon’s Italy, a place of orange
groves and pillared palaces. In the
ardour of her revolt against the naturalist
school she often, no doubt, became
grotesque. Her landscapes are as gloriously
unreal as the heroes and heroines
who move through them. But what of
that? Unreality has its own charm,
and even its own truth.</p>

<p>Certainly that May in Dresden I read
with uncavilling love all that she had to
tell of Ischl, in the Austrian Alps, on
whose mountains you may shoot, if you
will, the golden eagle and the vulture.
And with envy and longing I read how
Vere and Correze retreated from the
world to an old house, simple yet noble,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
with terraces facing the Alps of the
Valais. Here on the hills above Sion
the air is pure and clear as crystal, strong
as wine, the cattle maiden sings on the
high grass slopes, and the fresh-water
fisherman answers her from his boat on
the lake below. In vain I reminded
myself that one does not shoot golden
eagles, and that the Valaisan peasants,
bent by ceaseless labour almost out of
human semblance, have neither the
leisure nor the wish to carol songs to
one another. The divine unreason of
romance was too strong for me, quickening
and giving colour to a prosaic discontent
with a studious life in a too
orderly German town.</p>

<p>And so it came about, exactly when
and how I forget, that I decided to go to
Switzerland: a simple decision, yet thrilling
enough to me just free from ten
years of school discipline. The German
family with which I was staying had
fixed on a Bavarian village, Oberkreuzberg
by name, for their summer holidays.
It seemed to me that this village would
be a convenient base from which to make
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
a hurried dash of two or three days to
the Alps. Bavaria, however, was a
bigger place than I had thought, and
Oberkreuzberg, when I arrived there
one evening in the middle of July,
seemed desolatingly apart from the world.
And though, as the days passed, I grew
to love the place, this sense of detachment
did not weaken. Oberkreuzberg
was set on a spur of the highest mountain
in the Bavarian Forest. From the
church that crowned the hill the houses
fell sharply away to the south on either
side of the straggling main street. In
all directions, except the north, the outlook
was bounded only by the horizon.
To the east were the low-lying Bohemian
hills, to the south the Danube, and the
plain beyond, where Munich lies, and
farther still the mountains of Tyrol,
visible to the naked eye, so the villagers
said, on a clear winter day. And to the
south-west, visible to me alone, hung the
chain of the Swiss Alps. The wide
prospect made the village seem not less
but more obscure. To those locked in
a narrow valley, however desolate, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
world lies on the other side of the hills.
But between Oberkreuzberg and the world
lay expanses stretching away to dim
horizons.</p>

<p>The villagers took a frank delight and
interest in me that further strengthened
my feeling of distance from ordinary life.
Stray Germans from the north, burghers
from Munich, came with each summer,
but hitherto no Englishman had visited
the village. My arrival was an event.
Indeed, Herr Göckeritz, the genial old
Saxon with whom I stayed in Dresden,
told me that it had been mentioned in a
sermon as a token of Oberkreuzberg’s
spreading fame. I was a reversed Haroun-al-Raschid,
important because unknown.
The village children followed me about
curiously, and when I shut myself in
my room clamoured outside till appeased
with largesse of pfennig pieces. On the
grass in front of my window lay logs
ready for building purposes, and the Annas,
Marias, and Babettes of the village,
small bare-legged girls, used to disport
themselves there every afternoon, chasing
each other from log to log with reckless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
agility. In the fields near by I could see
their elders working, bent battered peasants.</p>

<p>Outside the village were scattered some
large boulders, and on the flat top of one
of these I would spend an hour or two
each afternoon, reading and meditating.
The blue distances troubled me with the
vague longings which had stirred to song
many a little German poet in the days
before Bismarck. The melodies of their
heart’s unrest are mere sentimental vapourings
to the modern critic. What does
it all mean, he asks, this talk of
wandering, knapsack on back, into the
wide world to seek the blue flower of
romance on the blue hills of the horizon?
In the same spirit Leslie Stephen,
the high-priest of orthodox mountain-worship,
found Byron’s Swiss poetry
cheap and insincere. As a hard-headed
agnostic, suspicious of emotion not
founded on fact, he resented no doubt
such verse as:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘The fish swam by the castle wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And they seemed joyous each and all.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The eagle rode the rising blast,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Methought he never flew so fast.’<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

<p>This eagle, flying past Chillon to the
mountains of Ouida’s Ischl, rode a
purely romantic blast, and was visible
only to romantic eyes. The orthodox
climber, however, does not care for
romance. His love of the mountains is
based, like domestic love, on knowledge
and understanding. It is reasoned, almost
respectable. But the visions of Byron
and of the German Romantics have the
magic of first love, passionately adoring
what is unknown and out of reach. It
is profitless to weigh romance against
reason. I can only say that I never
loved the mountains better than in those
long afternoons when they shone before
my spirit, hidden from the eyes of my
body.</p>

<p>Cynara, when she reads these pages,
will dismiss all this talk of yearnings,
spiritual unrest, and what not as literary
verbiage. And indeed I might never
have left Bavaria, had it not been for
memories of the previous summer at
Champex, where I had rowed and
climbed and quarrelled with Cynara,
and where Cynara’s sister, who cultivated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
a conscientious contempt for men in
general, and myself in particular, had
stung my young soul by insisting that
there were in me the makings of a
blameless curate. This summer they
had gone to Saas Fee, and Cynara wrote
to me from there, praising the place
ardently, and ending her letter with the
careless-cruel hope that I would like
Bavaria. Like Bavaria! And the letter
had reached me on the damp, dark evening
of my arrival at Oberkreuzberg.
The need for a personal protest reinforcing
my desire towards the Alps
settled any lingering hesitation. I had
four pounds with me. Before leaving
Dresden I wrote, in the hope of increasing
this sum, an essay for a competition
in the <i>Saturday Westminster</i>.
The subject was, ‘On making a Fool of
Oneself,’ and I treated the theme with a
humour which at the time seemed quite
delicious. In retrospect I am astonished
that they gave me an honourable mention.
Cruder methods of raising money
proved more successful, and a generous
uncle solved all material difficulties.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span></p>

<p>Two evenings before I started I went
with Herr Göckeritz after supper to one
of the village inns. The landlord played
the zither, and Herr Göckeritz, after telling
a few anecdotes rather broad than
long, sang a little wistful ditty of a poor
fiddler wandering through the world in
sunshine and rain, with no friend but his
fiddle:&mdash;</p>

<div xml:lang="de" class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Und wenn einst vor der letzten Tür<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Mein letztes Lied verklang,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Und wenn an meiner Geige mir<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Die letzte Saite sprang,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ach, nur ein Plätzchen gönnt mir dann<br /></span>
<span class="i3">An stiller Friedhofswand,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Wo von der Wandrung ruhen kann<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Der arme Musikant.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The whole essence of that lovable absurd
German romanticism is in these lines.
They haunted me on my journey, and
long after, and even now have power to
quicken the memory of those days. As
we walked home beneath a quiet starry
sky I told Herr Göckeritz that I was
going to Switzerland. His only comment
was an offer to lend me some money.
Life is like that.</p>

<p>It was shortly before five o’clock
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
in the morning that I set out on my
journey. For economy’s sake I had
decided to walk to a station fifteen miles
away, thus saving, as I later realised, a
little more than sixpence. My clothes
were in a Gladstone bag which I hung
over my shoulders, pulling the straps
into position with a handkerchief tied
across my chest. And so, a curious
figure, I swung down a path that led
to the main road through a little wood.
Before entering the wood I turned round
for a last look at the village. It seemed
in the still dawn a living thing, sad, and
lonely, and patient, like its inhabitants.
For the moment I felt sorry to go. It
was unlikely that Saas Fee would welcome
me with wonder and delight. It
was probable that neither Cynara nor
Cynara’s sister would regard me with the
affectionate awe of Maria, Anna, and
Babette. However, I did not return.</p>

<p>The memory of that walk has become
like the memory of a dream. When I
think of it I understand those words of
Sir Thomas Browne: ‘My life has been
a miracle of thirty years; which to relate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
were not a history, but a piece of poetry,
and would sound like a fable.’ He was
thinking, I fancy, not of any events
suitable as titles for the chapters in a
biography, but of stray incidents unrelated
to the main course of his life.
Such stray incidents have a magical
quality. They might have happened,
you feel, to a stranger in some forgotten
age, so unattached to ordinary life do
they seem. By a lucky chance they
happened to you, and you remember
them with a love and gratitude incomprehensible
to others. In those hours
the melody of your own little life sounded
in accord with the universal harmony,
and the echo of that music never dies
away.</p>

<p>I passed on through waking villages.
On either side of the road were low-lying
hills, where trees half hid ruined
castles. Were they really castles? The
early morning turned everything to magic,
and I seemed to walk in a dream-country
of the Middle Ages, my journey a
pilgrimage, and my goal a noble one,
though the way was over-easy. With
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
the tenth mile the enchantment vanished,
as dawn dissolved into day. I became
conscious of my Gladstone bag, and the
handkerchief across my chest cramped
me like a steel band. And so, when I
came over a small rising and saw before
me the factory chimneys of Regen, my
destination, I welcomed modern ugliness
with relief, and pressed forward to the
squalor of a train. The journey to
Munich lasted for six stifling summer
hours. Opposite me in the railway
carriage sat an old woman, wrinkled and
furrowed, incessantly munching ham
sandwiches. I suffered agonies of vicarious
thirst, and being a teetotaller found no assuagement
in the draughts of beer which
she drank at every station. At last the
train dawdled into Munich. The weather
had changed, and I spent seven hours
taking shelter from sudden showers, and
brooding on the probability that for the
next few days the Swiss mountains would
be hidden in clouds. A night’s journey
brought me to Zurich, dull and dismal in
the early morning. By this time I had
become an advanced realist, with a super-shavian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
hatred of romance in every sense
of that word.</p>

<p>This was the lowest ebb, and now
romance came flooding back. Lausanne
at noon was lovely. There was the
white house where Cynara used to live;
old memories quickened at the sight.
Martigny shone like a dream against the
Champex mountains. And then, as the
train rushed up the Rhone valley, I leant
from the window, and the trees and the
bushes bending before the wind seemed
swaying with my ecstasy.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon I left Stalden
for the last stage of my journey, a fifteen-mile
ascent to Saas Fee. Beyond the
bridge near the village a young climber
overtook me as I stopped to readjust
my bag. It appeared that he too had
come from Munich, that we had a
common friend, and that he wished to
make the acquaintance of Cynara and
her sister. So we walked on together.
Behind us the Bietschorn shone a golden
peak in the sunset. On each side of
the narrow, high valley fell numberless
cascades, pouring into the central torrent.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
Yes, this was Switzerland at last, far
lovelier with its roaring waters and scent
of pine-trees than in the dim visions of
those stifling Dresden days. I had reached
the blue hills of the horizon, and the sinking
sun had turned them to gold.</p>

<p>We came to Saas Grund at eve, and
the last steep pull to Saas Fee was made
in the dark. As we entered the village
my companion left me, turning to the
left towards his hotel. I stopped a
minute to recover my breath. It was
the first of August, the day of the
national festival. All the hotels were
illuminated; men and women crowded
the balconies, in fancy dress, and the
crowd below ran here and there, laughing
and chattering. A fantastic sight;
for a moment I was embarrassed by the
idea that they were celebrating my
arrival. Moving forward diffidently, I
entered the Hôtel du Dom by the cellar
door, and walked cautiously upstairs.
There was no more glory in me, and,
except for my anxiety to avoid Cynara,
I was not conscious of any particular
feeling.

<h2 id="V_THE_MOUNTAINEER_AND_THE_PILGRIM">V. THE MOUNTAINEER
AND THE PILGRIM</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">‘The</span> pilgrim,’ says a modern
writer, ‘is one who has made
an appointment with his higher
self, to meet at some distant date and
place.’ He sets aside for a season his
present interests and the call of work,
intent on satisfying that part of his
nature which is in danger of suffering
from starvation. Therefore, with staff
in hand, he turns his back on the
familiar, to take, in strange places, something
more than a holiday. For the
pilgrim is no mere holiday-maker; he is
rather the ideal traveller, journeying towards
a noble end, and happy in this
knowledge; and to attain this end he
welcomes the prospect of passing through
fire and water.</p>

<p>The circumstances and spirit of this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
age do not encourage the pilgrim’s existence;
yet enthusiasm and endurance are
virtues which do not perish with the
pilgrim. Moreover, even if our ideal
traveller is found no more, many find an
ideal form of travel in mountaineering.
There may exist, therefore, some corresponding
virtue, some relic of the pilgrim’s
security of mind, by reason of which we
may call our mountaineer a pilgrim.</p>

<p>What manner of man is this new
pilgrim who frequents the mountain-side?
Can he indeed be called pilgrim,
unless perhaps he is following in the
steps of Boniface of Asti, who first
ascended a snowy mountain and built a
chapel for worshippers? Do we ever
find the counterpart of Chaucer’s Knight
and Poure Persoun, or even of his
Manciple and Miller?</p>

<p>In truth, the perfect mountain pilgrim
is as rare as was the genuine humble-minded
visitor of shrines. We must look
to the Japanese climbers for the finest
example:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Clad in white, symbolical of the
purity to which they aspire, these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
ascetic mountaineers make their way,
sometimes at the end of several weeks
of walking, to the top of their peak.
After worship at the shrine of their
mountain divinity, they withdraw to
some secluded spot.’</p></blockquote>

<p>Yet even if such a type be exceptional,
there may still lie hidden some of the
pilgrim’s worth in the ordinary climber.
With the latter, as with the older
pilgrims, we must separate the sheep
from the goats. Pilgrimages were made,
not only for spiritual benefit, but also for
boasting, as an excuse for an exchange of
masters, and in certain instances to annoy
the king. Nobody climbs, as far as I
know, to annoy any king; but the presence
of many men in the Alps and elsewhere
is not easily explained without harsh
words. For the climber is notoriously
an unsatisfactory person, not only to the
uninitiated, but to his fellow-enthusiasts.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is open to all men to become mountain
pilgrims. Many, however, in whom
the Hill Difficulty arouses no fear, will
be content to stop by the wayside and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
wrestle daily with some Apollyon of a
‘rock problem.’ There are some who
find all mountains dull which have no
wrong way up, who will talk for hours
about a billiard-table traverse, and dismiss
the ascent of Mont Blanc from Chamonix
in a few contemptuous words; and if
they succeed in such endeavours, they are
for hailing themselves the lords of all the
earth. Had Aristotle witnessed their
labours he might have remarked: ‘Such
things even a slave may do’; and if I
had the arrangement of Dante’s Hell I
should put them lower than the man who
descended the Breithorn playing on a
mouth-organ, although at the time it
seemed that he</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Tooke out his black trumpe of bras,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That fouler than the Devil was.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Let such climbers remember that
Apollyon can break out into a grievous
rage, and that he is a very subtle thrower
of darts, or even stones; and note that
among later Alpine disasters a great
majority have occurred in places of extreme
difficulty, to the detriment of a
noble sport.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

<p>Yet admitting the existence of pleasure
in such unstable equilibrium, we may
still criticise its quality. True pleasure,
says the pilgrim, cannot exist without
peace of mind in some degree; and few
minds can remain unruffled on the wall
of the Devil’s Kitchen. Indeed, such
vain seeking after pleasure is often, like
Bunthorne’s Mediævalism, ‘born of a
morbid love of admiration.’ Christian’s
fight with Apollyon was merely an
incident of travel, which no doubt ceased
to interest him; his way was beset by
difficulties sufficient to occupy his energy.
Similarly the mountain pilgrim constantly
seeks fresh fields for activity, and
will gladly turn his back on the
‘specialists’; for these men climb as it
were for gain, nursing within themselves
a spirit of competition in their struggle
with the force of gravity. Nor can they
look with pleasure upon their failures,
as can their less ambitious brethren. It
is among the latter that we shall find the
spirit of the mountain pilgrim which
caused Kim’s Lama to exclaim:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Oh! the hills and the snow upon the hills!’<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

<p>The wise man will not wholly judge the
mountaineer while he is on the mountain-side.
Some enthusiastic climbers maintain
that two moments alone afford
pleasure in an expedition: when the
summit is reached, and when the valley
is regained. Now, these words may
confound the sharp-witted philosophers
of the plain, but the climber knows that
they contain a world of truth, and that a
great joy lies in retrospection, for which
he will endure many hours of tribulation.
In this retrospective attitude we shall
find the climber at his best; his attention
is relaxed, and he is free to summon back
the greater moments of the past day.
Meet him in the evening on the terrace
at Breuil, when the bowlers have at
length ceased their bowling, looking
down at the lights in the hollow below:
you will find in him much of the true
pilgrim spirit. Further, the pilgrim
proper would be the first to recognise a
fellow-traveller in this mountain wanderer.
He sees that on the mountains
also another may meet his higher self.
The difference between the two lies only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
in environment. To both alike the end
is denied without the struggle, and the
generous pilgrim will not trouble to contrast
the excellences of their ways. The
two will shake hands in satisfaction that
the old self is no longer in dangerous
proximity. But our generous pilgrim,
judging men by his own standard, is a
stern critic, and does not suffer fools
gladly.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>We are apt to picture the mediæval
pilgrim as a man travelling in some ease
and comfort. The nine and twenty
sundry folk that met one April in the
Tabard Inn seem a well-living band:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘And wel we weren esed atte beste.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But those who went on a longer journey
encountered many hardships. The English
pilgrim to the shrine of St. James at
Compostella usually travelled by sea, in
cramped quarters on a small boat; on
which, besides the necessity of crossing
the Bay of Biscay, he frequently found
an unsympathetic captain:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Hale the bowelyne! now, vere the shete!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Cooke, make redy anoon our mete,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Our pylgryms have no lust to ete,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">I pray God yeve hem rest!’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And at the worst moment up comes a
hearty sailor, shouting: ‘Cheer up! in a
moment we shall be in a storm.’ On
the journey from Venice to Jaffa, says a
fellow of Eton, a sharp look-out must be
kept on the captain, lest he give you bad
meat; the pilgrim must take with him
hens and chickens; on arrival at Jaffa
there will be a hideous scramble for
mules, and your mule-man will expect
a tip.</p>

<p>The pilgrim who endured these discomforts
not only gained much spiritual
benefit for himself, he benefited also his
fellow-men. On his return he must have
been amazingly good company, and
brought a fresh interest into his neighbours’
lives, who vowed to perform a
similar journey, profiting by their forerunner’s
experience. The lot of those
fortunate ones who climbed in the ‘sixties
was very similar. They set out to explore
some little-known district, thinking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
more of passing from place to place than
of ascending a peak. They possessed the
pilgrim spirit in the unity of their object,
in their endurance, and especially in their
attitude towards adversity and failure.
They travelled of set purpose to a comparatively
barbarous land, where often
there was no safe lodging for the night:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘What care I for a goose-feather bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With a sheet turned down so bravely&mdash;O!’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Moreover, they went out amid the
jeers of their friends, and it needed more
than ordinary faith to confirm them in
their search for this mysterious good.
They had, through hours of toil and
vexation, the doubtful joy of discovering
a thousand errors in the map. The
modern climber owes a great debt to
their exploration; for although he may
find a subject of conversation in his
sufferings from tourists and trains, he
finds better paths and better inns, and
stands far less chance of a night upon
the rocks.</p>

<p>The gods of the ‘sixties did not exhaust
the Alps. Rather, they created a new
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
form of enthusiasm in the world. Alpine
climbing has developed rapidly, and on
somewhat similar lines to the public
schools. It is no longer necessary to
rise at five a.m. and break the ice before
washing; therefore a larger number of
boys can enjoy the full benefits of school
life. Climbing is now no longer reserved
for those who have leisure and money;
it has become the most democratic of
sports, thanks largely to the labours of
the early explorers. The fact that the
mountains have been, as it were, thrown
open to the public has brought a wondrous
amount of interest into many colourless
lives.</p>

<p>Some day this enthusiasm, which is
discernible even in the mad rush of
tourists, may die out. At present it
flourishes alarmingly, with attendant
evils; but the purpose which first drew
men to the Alps fifty years ago and more
remains unspoiled even by guide-books
and tourists:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Low as the singer lies in the field of heather,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Songs of his fashion bring the swains together.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The air on the mountains, the need
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
for endurance, the appointment with the
higher self, continue and will continue
to make their appeal. Further, in spite
of railways and huts, discomforts abound;
for the sun still shines as brightly as in
1860, and the labour of wading in soft
snow does not decrease with the ages.
In this era of enlightenment there is
not denied to men the privilege of being
dirty; the chalet which flows with milk
for the descending climber still recalls
memories of the Augean stables and
makes one sigh for Heracles. Straw is
the order in most club huts, and the
climber must prepare his own food. So
long as discomforts exist the pilgrim’s
endurance is demanded, and there still
remain plenty of annoyances to make
the traveller ‘nasty, brutish and short.’</p>

<p>Again, it is not only by physical trials
such as these, but by mental trials also,
that the virtues of the pilgrim are called
into being. Christian, more fortunate
than most guideless wanderers, dropped
his burden early, and he becomes a more
interesting as well as a finer person when
he is busy fighting some subtle temptation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
of mind. The mountain pilgrim
will have to fight as hard for his peace
of mind; he is a prey, as was Christian,
to ‘the carnal arguments of one Mr.
Worldly Wiseman.’ The latter finds
his way, in body as well as in spirit, to
the most secluded corners of the Alps.
He is certainly what many would call a
‘centrist,’ except that he gave up climbing
at an early age. He delights in
pointing out the futility of risking an
otherwise valuable neck in the pursuit
of discomfort and vain glory; in his
view, the climber has nothing to lose
and everything to gain by shirking all
difficulties. He is very deft in forcing
his convictions on others, and his arguments
will recur to the traveller with
distressing force at inconvenient moments.
He knows that almost every climber has
on occasion vowed never to climb again,
and it is a constant marvel to him that
so many break this vow within a few
hours’ time. It needs all the climber’s
resolution, supported by a prospect of
sensuous delights as a reward of labour,
to repel his promptings; but it is a great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
joy to confute him ‘ambulando.’ He is
fighting a losing battle, which has lasted
fifty years; but although there is little
hope of victory, the battle is never
entirely lost so long as the tale of man’s
slackness is undiminished.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The pilgrim of the Middle Ages had
many shrines which he might choose to
visit. To this shrine ran a good road
when once the mountains were crossed;
to another there was the drawback of a
sea voyage; at a third shrine the good
saint was a potent healer, and the distance
to be covered would afford a good penance
for the pilgrim’s ill-deeds; moreover, he
would find free entertainment at most
places on the way. Thus there was
food for absorbing reflection before setting
out, and much thought needed for
the details of the way. I fancy the
Lord of Anglure-sur-Aube must have
taken an astonishing interest in organising
the long journey for his large troop
of pilgrims. Yet the pious pilgrim may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
have regarded this interest with suspicion,
as enticing the mind from thoughts of
the true object of the pilgrimage&mdash;too
much thought for the morrow.</p>

<p>Likewise the modern mountaineer is
free to ponder and make his choice,
having before him a district of many
thousand square miles from which to
select. He enjoys, therefore, all the
pilgrim’s freedom of choice; and from
this freedom a demon of restlessness
arises which the pilgrim would not
encourage in himself.</p>

<p>The truth is that the mountaineer
does encourage this restless feeling in
himself, notwithstanding the pilgrim’s
protests. He welcomes the arrival of
this fatal gad-fly which drives him yearly
southward. And whereas the pilgrim,
being no faddist, accepts what comes in
a spirit of cheerfulness, and looks askance
at anything that may vex his peace of
mind, the mountaineer knows that only
after diligent search can he secure the
best which the mountains have to offer.
He is indeed a genuine faddist in planning.
He chooses his route with as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
much care as he chooses a companion.
He will sit for hours or even days of his
spare time before a heap of maps and
guide-books; for every expedition chosen
he will have rejected twenty, forming his
imaginary tour by a process of elimination
rather than of selection. Only when
he is thoroughly familiar with every
corner of a district does he consent to
choose his peak or pass. Three things
are necessary for the ideal expedition: a
great variety in the ascent, a fine view
(I would instance the Aletschhorn or the
Tour St. Pierre), and an easy descent,
preferably over snow. This combination
is not found on every mountain; it
is therefore all the more fascinating to
seek for such by map and guide-book;
and when this ideal expedition is at
length discovered the climber will anticipate
it with pleasure for months beforehand&mdash;thus
forestalling the joys of
summer, and with far less searching of
heart than in the event. In this discontent
with his own planning he gains
an interest and occupation, without any
of the pilgrim’s prickings of conscience.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

<p>The latter, however, has also certain
advantages. He retains his peace of
mind far more easily than does the
mountaineer. He is free to rest when
he may choose, to lie throughout the
noon-day heat&mdash;‘patulae recubans sub
tegmine fagi’; nor does he care one rap
about ‘times.’ To the mountaineer, on
the contrary, a long halt is not often
permitted; for he must always keep
some spare time before him, lest some
sudden obstacle leave him for the night
on the mountain-side. So long as the
rope is still round his waist he is not
often entirely free from some anxiety,
and he remains somewhat restless in
spirit until the path leading valleywards
is reached. It is therefore not surprising
to find the most calm of men turn quick-tempered
upon the mountains, a state
of mind which agrees ill with their
enthusiasm. It is difficult to explain
away this fault as superficial; for the
serene pilgrim can point to a hundred
instances where the climber was in such
a bad temper that he would allow no
one else their share in the hard work.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
But if a slight matter can upset him,
his good temper returns also as quickly
as it departs; and if you keep out
of his way while busy and meet him
jogging peacefully down through the
thickening pine woods towards evening,
you will find him as cheerful a companion
as the wanton and merry Friar.</p>

<p>Again, both in the pilgrim and the
mountaineer there is a delight in the
unexpected; which is a remarkable
thing, since the mountaineer, unlike the
pilgrim, has chosen what he is to expect
in detail. The pilgrim sets out to bear
cheerfully such adventures as may lie in
Fortune’s lap; the mountaineer has been
planning for months, and a cherished
scheme may fail owing to bad weather
or other mischance. However, he takes
a certain pleasure in failure, for he has
discovered two benefits to be derived
from it. That which is unaccomplished
one year may be carried out at a later
date, until which time the hope of
success makes ample amends for the
failure; also an unsuccessful attempt
often leaves a greater stamp on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
memory, when the mountain is seen in
wrathful mood. The climber may praise
himself for perseverance or prudence,
throwing all blame upon the shoulders
of Chance. He goes out, indeed, half
prepared to fail; he is extravagantly
thankful for small mercies received; he
adopts a somewhat pessimistic attitude,
since</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Luck’s a chance, but trouble sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I’d face it as a wise man should,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And train for ill and not for good.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Some might see in him the vices of
the born grumbler; for with him the
weather is rarely perfect, and when
perfect it is too often about to break.
But it is part of the climber’s vanity to
be more weather-wise than Nature herself;
and to all appearance he mildly
resents even a change for the good which
does not accord with his prophecy.</p>

<p>Further, the unexpected is not always
evil; the climber may stumble upon a
new route, and even the most hardened
scoffer at such things will admit a secret
delight in reading his name in the pages
of <i>Conway and Coolidge</i>. The unexpected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
is always at hand. I went up one day
to the hut on the south-west ridge of
the Matterhorn, in a wind sufficient to
take the horns off the oxen; and that
night I lay awake, like Strepsiades,</p>

<div xml:lang="el" class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">ἐν πέντε σισύραις ἐγκεκορδυλημένος<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>listening to the wind howling and the
clatter of stones and ice falling from the
Great Tower upon the roof. Next morning
the wind dropped at sunrise, and a
warm, cloudless day followed, of that
wonderful clearness which foretells the
advent of bad weather. One more instance
of the unexpected&mdash;and in this I have my
justification: that day we were in a sense
pilgrims, for we set out to discover a
route by which men might pass direct
from the Ober Steinberg to the Concordia.
We started in light, rolling mist,
and towards sunrise looked down upon
a cloud-sea hiding the deep-cut valley of
Lauterbrunnen. Then crossing a world
of stones we climbed a steep, short
glacier, and over a heap of avalanche-debris
reached the lowest rocks of our
mountain, the Mittaghorn. Here we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
had expected difficulty with a steep band
of rock, but passed rapidly upwards without
check to where the angle eased off.
Then came trouble, for the rock became
of a loose slaty texture, in places covered
with ice. Higher up matters improved,
until we reached the foot of a great
overhanging wall of red rock, which
turned us left along a narrow ledge and
round jutting corners, to where a steep
ice gully cut through the wall. I was
left standing in a vast ice step, from
which I could see nothing but the
leader’s foot searching now and then for
some cranny in the rock. Below me a
great ice slope ran down with alarming
steepness and then dipped over, beyond
which I saw the green valley and our
hotel; in the far distance I could see
the ripples sparkling on the Lake of
Thun, and above the sunlight was playing
on a patch of rocks which had come
no nearer after two hours’ hard work.
On such occasions time passes slowly to
those who only stand and wait, and I
was right glad when they hoisted me
over the rock wall and into the sunlight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
once more. To our disgust the summit
lay still far off to our left, and to attain
it we had to follow a narrow ridge of
sloppy snow; on the far side of the
peak we found crusted snow, to complete
our tribulation. Thus we found both
good and evil unexpectedly, and like
Christian fell ‘from running to going,
and from going to clambering upon
hands and knees,’ until we wished ourselves
trippers once more.</p>

<p>It is, above all, when the climber
passes from one valley to another that
the unexpected is liable to occur. He
then experiences all the pilgrim’s joy
of wandering, the uncertainty of the
night’s lodging, the pleasure of tracing
out the next day’s ascent on the far hillside.
He will follow the line of path
through the pine wood, and train his
powers of observation, learning, moreover,
to trust his own eyes in preference
to the map. Though he may not see
cities, he will see many men, and will
find hospitality as unselfish as in the
days when all travellers and pilgrims
were objects of pity. He travels from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
place to place with a pilgrim’s desire to
find the ideal peak or valley. There are
not many that find it; and this failure
in the search is due partly to the
climber’s own natural restlessness, partly
to his intense desire to see if the Happy
Valley may not lie just round the corner.
He feeds this discontent with his present
circumstances, knowing that in so doing
he gets the greatest joy. He is in no
hurry to find this Happy Valley; nor,
if he never find it, will he consider that
he has climbed in vain.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Both pilgrim and mountaineer may
claim for themselves the virtue of enthusiasm.
But if they be humble-minded
men they will not deny the
possible existence of other and nobler
forms of enthusiasm. If this virtue of
theirs be not identical with all excellence,
it must be capable of definition or
analysis in terms other than itself. The
pilgrim’s answer is easily given: he goes
out to seek recreation, in the fullest sense
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
of the word, to introduce a new element
into his life. ‘I go to free myself from
the Wheel of Things by a broad and
open road.’ Less easy to define is the
<span xml:lang="el">τέλος</span> of the mountaineer; under no moral
compulsion, he endures the pilgrim’s
hardships for a less definite end, yet
returns year after year in search of discomfort.
A writer endeavouring to
analyse this enthusiasm has put it
down as a mild madness, a drawback
to mountain-climbing. It is in great
part an enthusiasm for past and future:
put the mountaineer among his hills,
and he is no sooner in full training than
he begins to anticipate with joy his
return to civilisation. Place him once
more at home, and he will be eager to
return to his old haunts, will busy himself
in planning for the next year. He
climbs, as it seems, against his will.</p>

<p>Yet he sets out willingly in search of
recreation, knowing that he will certainly
find it through hours of toil. He finds
also a very full pleasure, forgetting readily
the early start and all the thousand inconveniences
which afford copy for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
scribbler. The moon in the pine woods,
the early dawn in the upper snow, the
descent of Mont Blanc towards the sunset
are not for valley-dwellers; and to
attain these rewards the mountaineer
welcomes the opportunity of an enforced
self-denial:&mdash;</p>

<div xml:lang="la" class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Carnis terat Superbiam<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Potus cibique parcitas.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He shares also the pilgrim’s joy of solitude
and contemplation in the long hours
of silence, and the joy of friendly conversation
with all manner of men at the
close of day. He regards no day, however
trying, as wasted which is spent
above snow-line, and next day he can
take his ease in the valley with a clear
conscience. ‘It is pleasant,’ says Leslie
Stephen, ‘to lie on one’s back in a bed
of rhododendrons, and look up to a
mountain-top peering at one from above
a bank of cloud; but it is pleasantest
when one has qualified oneself for repose
by climbing the peak the day before, and
becoming familiar with its terrors and its
beauties.’ Herein lies a point of resemblance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
between pilgrim and mountaineer:
to feel the need of qualifying for this
repose, which loses half its value when
it is not the reward of labour.</p>

<p>Finally, the mountaineer will learn two
secrets by experience. He will discover
the secret of those philosophers that have
dominion over the young, that one may
argue (on mountains as elsewhere) from
any given premise with equally convincing
logic to two contrary conclusions.
This is the essence of the mountaineer’s
freedom of mind; for wherever he may
find himself he can advance many reasons
for or against every proposal, as conscience-free
as the pilgrim himself,
calling in prudence to support equally
his bold or his lazy wishes; which is a
dangerous thing for all climbers, as Mr.
Worldly Wiseman knows. He will
learn also the secret of a true holiday,
which the pilgrim possesses: that this lies,
not in the abandonment of everything
familiar in search of distraction, but in
taking up some fresh and absorbing
interest, which will continue from one
holiday to another.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
durability of their materials, were begun
in a stream inland; pools were made,
and the stream diverted into a new, or
perhaps a long disused, channel. Sometimes,
too, a party of us would explore
along a stream to its source, which we
rarely reached, since even small streams
are apt to extend farther than childish
zeal will endure, though fired by the
ambition of finding a real spring, entrancing
to the dwellers among sluggish south-country
rivers.</p>

<p>But it was with our first visit to the
Alps that the revelation came. Here
were streams without number, small
enough to follow, during the course
of a long picnicking day, up to real
authentic springs, which bubbled clear
and cold from the ground at our feet.
Geography could be made and altered;
our dams made pools where none were
before, or caused the paths and water-courses
of the neighbourhood to exchange
their functions, so that the inhabitants
of lonely chalets found their water supply
miraculously curtailed, and visited the
culprits up above with guttural wrath.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
Watersheds, things hard for the low-lander
to comprehend&mdash;mere imaginary
lines drawn across gently swelling sand-ridges
or downs&mdash;gained new life when
seen as the jagged ridge of the Engelhörner,
or the great line of green hills
north from the Schwartzhorn to the
bastion of Tschingli over Haslithal.</p>

<p>With the magic of water was joined
the mystery of the other side. If we
followed any of the streams up and up,
to the Engelhörner or the Schöniwanghörner,
whither should we see the
torrents going, when the rain that fell
on the mountains streamed down the far
side? The quest of the geographer was
made concrete; and as water has been the
chief power in the making of geography,
so it is first to start the quest in a child’s
imagination, and the best guide in the
knight-errantry of childhood. But the
streams that fell from the precipices of
the Engelhörner and Wellhorn pointed
out a course beyond our ambitions; not
yet could we aspire to be climbers, and
they still guard their secret, though ready
to yield it, now the time has come, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
an ambition strengthened with strengthened
limbs. Even the grass slopes of the
Schöniwanghörner were too high to
cross; but the great day came when we
started at six, with two mules, to cross
the Great Scheidegg, so long a barrier
at the head of the valley slung between
Wetterhorn and Schwartzhorn, with
Grindelwald as our object.</p>

<p>It was a water-following on a great
scale; we started with the sound of the
Reichenbach falls in our ears, and followed
along the line of least resistance, made by
the stream. Still before breakfast we
passed the Schwartzwald, where the
stream was already shorn of so much of
its strength that it could be harnessed
and made to pass through hollowed half
tree-trunks to do the work of a saw-mill.
Higher up was the region of bogs and
grass slopes, each few hundred yards
sending its half-buried tinkling trickle
to join the head waters of the river
itself. And then, without warning, the
path took a final zig, and brought us
to the top; and for the first time we
saw part of the land of the other waters,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
with the other glaciers and snow-fields,
grass peaks and stony ones, which gave
them birth. We saw how the valleys
bent round to Thun and Brienz, how
the valley of Lauterbrunnen and the
peak of the Jungfrau fitted on to a
world whose horizon had been suddenly
enlarged; looking for those places above
all which had gained special interest and
familiarity from the pictured slips in our
chocolate packets.</p>

<p>That evening, after a hot trudge up
from Grindelwald, and a cool descent
along the home stream that somehow
rested our tired limbs, we returned to
Rosenlaui with a new sense of expansion
and a vague feeling of the coherence of
things, for the dead lines of the map
had become actual and living before our
eyes. Yet this feeling soon gave place to
the disappointing yet somehow thrilling
thought, that by enlarging our horizon
we had only left ourselves ringed about
by a wider circle of other sides, making
it still less likely than before that we
should ever solve the abiding questions
of our childhood.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span></p>

<p>For four years the Alps remained a
memory and a hope, till in 1907 the
long horrors of the Certificate Examination
were followed by the thrill of the
night journey, enjoyed to the full owing
to a constitutional inability to sleep, and
a drive from Martigny to the upper part
of the Val de Bagnes, a shut-in and self-centred
valley presided over by the
Combin. It was here that Italy became
identified with the other side. Here I
was first initiated as a climber, and taken
up the Ruinette; and for two lazy hours
on the top I watched the Italian mountains
raise themselves up from the ever-thickening
screen of mist with which
the Lombard plains seemed to be hiding
their secret. A few weeks later came
twenty minutes’ actual walking on Italian
soil, between the Great St. Bernard and
the Col de Fenêtre. Italy lay at our
feet, brought near to us by the road
winding down visibly to Aosta, and by
the first Italian notices of ‘Caccia Riservata,’
as well as by the southward-flowing
water.</p>

<p>That day saw, too, the registering of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
vow, fulfilled in the next year, to visit
the country of the Gran Paradiso and
the Grivola. Peaks there and around
Mont Blanc fell before our onslaught,
and we grew to be hardened climbers;
while passes became mere incidents in
the journey between one peak and another.
But Geography was roused from her
hiding-place by a walking tour two years
later&mdash;part of the regular ‘Tour of Mont
Blanc’ from Chamonix to Champex
with variations. The Col du Bonhomme
was unsatisfactory because, after much
display, it failed to turn a watershed at
the first attempt, and, after including the
Col des Fours, left us still in the Rhone
basin, with the Col de la Seigne between
us and Italy. Geography was displeased,
but her craving after completeness was
satisfied by the long drive from Aosta up
the Italian side of the Great St. Bernard.
Two known regions were linked up, and
of the remembered dips and corners of
the road seen from the top, each had had
its answer. Also I had a sense of triumph
in having cheated the powers of the
universe by taking several ounces of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
water in my soaked clothes across the
watershed to the Swiss side of the Col
de Fenêtre.</p>

<p>The passion still retained its childish
power, but in a wider sense. By being
children we had been nearly in the
position of the first primitive inhabitants
of such a country of mountain and valley:
to them peaks are haunts of terror and
danger, the parents of all the powers of
destruction&mdash;winds, avalanches, and lightnings&mdash;which
descend upon them; their
situation makes them geographers by
profession: at first their eyes are turned
down stream, and communication only
extends over the main valley and its
tributaries, till a more venturesome spirit
arises and uses the water as his guide,
but now, ascending it, takes the line of
least resistance over the passes to the
peoples of the neighbouring river-basins;
and ancient legends of hill tribes give a
prominent place to watersheds, and great
heroes are often made to conquer a
monster which has been terrorising the
valley, and fling him into some great
lake at the head of the waters of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
next basin. Did he not embody the
terror of those frowning walls, and was
not his conquest a victory indeed?</p>

<p>Thus the passes gained in importance,
while the peaks were afar off and terrible:
they were already in use when there
filtered through to Herodotus across
section after section of trade route the
tradition, confused in its long journey, of
a town of Pyrene and a river Alpis;
when a new wave of inhabitants, scarcely
pushing communication between valley
and valley themselves, used their mountain
hardiness to extract toll from the Roman
merchants whose enterprise brought them
across the St. Bernard and the Mont
Cenis to Vienna and Lugdunum; and
each traveller added to their importance
and fame, while the local paths were
linked up into great highways, joining
country to country, and shrine to
shrine, making a way for invasions,
for pilgrims, or for traders. The pass
where Xenophon’s men cried <span xml:lang="el">θάλασσα!
θάλασσα!</span> possesses a reality and interest
of its own, not shared by the almost
laughable description of the mythical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
peaks of Krophi and Mophi in Herodotus.
But for us, even as children,
there was a difference: the prowess and
achievements of our elders made impossible
the fear which our ancestors
felt even for ‘Helm Crag, Helvellyn,
and Butterlip Howe’&mdash;the last-named a
small wooded eminence about two hundred
feet high&mdash;yet we lacked the
spiritual and bodily pride which the
attainer of summits must possess. What
climber has not known the moment when
this has failed him suddenly, and he has
realised the impudence of his presence
among the mountain sanctuaries and of
his trial of strength face to face with the
mountain’s bulk; when he either expiates
the crime of his intrusion by a great and
tranquillising humility, or struggles, only
to find all he sees assume a mask of
grinning hatefulness? The attainer of
summits follows a way which, even if
definite, is none the less new and none
the less formidable to each successive
user: we children, like them, were pass-goers,
enterers of a sanctuary of a different
kind, one hallowed by the slow toil of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
generations, where the mountains could
not resent intrusion, since it was the
mark of their community of life with
the humble folk whom they supported.</p>

<p>Even then we were no longer geographers
by profession, still less now,
when the Alps are to us no longer a
barrier to be forced, but the playground
of Europe, whither we in our sophisticated
age make trains convey us; and it
seems as if the amateur geography of our
childhood were a mere survival, to be
put away together with other childish
things when we grow up to be ‘modern
men,’ with the climber’s devotion to
peaks, and the true modern appreciation
of mountains. Shall we not come to
treat passes as highest minima instead of
lowest maxima, and so despise them;
and will not our new mystical attitude
make the partial survival in us of
primitive man a bar to the growth of a
right spirit?</p>

<p>For your true mountain lover professes
himself a mystic: he is one of those that
‘live by places,’ and he waits upon the
fruition of those moments in which his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
senses give him a sudden feeling of fellowship
with his surroundings, when</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">‘A gentle shock of mild surprise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has carried far into his heart the voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mountain torrents; or the visible scene<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would enter unawares into his mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all its solemn imagery....’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These moments, he will tell you, are an
end in themselves, and not pursued for
any moral strengthening of our social
fibre for fighting the battles of life.
Only in isolation from his fellows, from
science, and from the interference of
intelligence, when he adopts a ‘wise
passivity’ of mere sensation, is this sense
of fellowship granted him; and among
the peaks, under the spell of his rhythmical
bodily movements, he and the
silent mountains stand face to face, as
pure living sensation and lifeless matter,
and each finds in the other a mysterious
completion.</p>

<p>This is the creed he professes; but how
rarely comes one who can practise it or
achieve its enjoyment. Nearly all indeed
share in some degree this passion for
fellowship; nearly all live their lives as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
much by places as by people. The contrast
is put by Wordsworth in one of
the poems on the Naming of Places,
that called ‘Joanna’s rock’:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Amid the smoke of cities did you pass<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The time of early youth; and there you learned,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From years of quiet industry, to love<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The living beings by your own fireside<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With such a strong devotion, that your heart<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Is slow towards the sympathies of them<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who look upon the hills with tenderness,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And make dear friendships with the streams and groves.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They are the extremes: Joanna cannot
understand the frame of mind at all;
Wordsworth is, in this mood, the perfect
example of the life lived in the fellowship
of inanimate things.</p>

<p>But to few is the fellowship thus
whole-heartedly given. For this it is
necessary to be a true æsthete (using the
word in an unprejudiced sense), so that
in the one indivisible act of seeing, the
one great moment, a whole message is
revealed. But life refuses to divide itself
into such moments; we cannot isolate
ourselves either from the continuity of
the past or the community of the present.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
Most men move on a plain of less concentration
and greater self-consciousness,
where the act of seeing inevitably includes
and leads up to reflection and analysis.
We still have the animal and the primitive
man within us, linking us to the
past and the flow of time; and reason,
the common gift of all men, keeps always
lurking in the background. Yet we still
strive after this immediacy of fellowship,
but there come times when the snow-peaks
and the rocks have fed our appreciation
on too strong a draught, when our
senses, relying on themselves alone, are
over-sated, and there seems a film before
our eyes, so that we are no longer ‘alive
and drinking up our wonder,’ but the
draught stagnates without us and turns
to bitterness.</p>

<p>Then we must be humble, and resign
our pretensions to an ‘æsthetic geography’
for one on a lower scale; we
shall return to the passes, which will
remain to us the emblem of a new
‘geography of the spirit’ which, instead
of trying to gain all in one tremendous
moment, will be content to browse upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
the myriad things which intelligence sees
displayed. Even as a picture, an arrangement
of lines and colours, the pass has
much that the higher peaks cannot give
us: the deep curve of the summit, slung
between its supporting peaks, appeals to
us by its grace and weakness; there is a
discontinuity of colour and clearness as
each bastion of the valley comes out from
the curve its forerunner had hidden.
But these effects are heightened and
brought together by our geography; we
imagine the glaciers that separated those
bastions from one another; that cup at
the end is perhaps the work of some
other mighty glacier of the far side, piled
up so high that it fell across the watershed
and cut its way down; maybe there
is a giant moraine, bigger than most of
our English mountains, still to bear
witness of it.</p>

<p>But it is the stream and the road which
hold our imagination; the water tells us
of all the powers which we know to be
at work, but which our senses are too
slow to perceive. Each stream is itself
part of the great cycle of water, each is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
an agent in the mountain cycle, perpetually
hurrying the actual fabric of the
mountains down to the sea; their voice
is never silent even on the summits; they
are the lords of the peaks, moulding
them slowly to new shapes, and their
murmur seems to call the clouds, ‘chased
by the hounding winds from distant
seas,’ to come and renew their springs for
a new course of the never-ending circle.</p>

<p>But the road takes our geography
farther afield and peoples our imaginings.
We have softened the immediacy of our
‘æsthetic geography’ by the aid of intelligence;
the road softens it by bringing
in humankind to stand with us facing
the gulf between the living and the
inanimate. As the water alters our view
of the mountains by bringing to light the
importance of time, so does the road alter
our view of ourselves. As we look up a
pass from below, the view of the road
appearing and vanishing round the folds
of the valley brings to us two pictures of
men. Winding away from us up to the
skyline goes the pilgrim’s progress, the
slow toiling advance upwards to gain the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
view of things not seen. Many there
are, but few together; some on side-tracks;
some on the old steep road with
its rough stones now overgrown, more
on the new smooth driving road which
turns about so that they can take their
eyes from the goal; some even making a
path for themselves, either above on the
hillside, steering for some nearer gap on
the skyline, which does not cross the main
watershed; others below the road, toiling
painfully along the stream-bed. And
each in turn we see reach the summit
and disappear; we cannot see what they
see, nor even the expression of their faces
as they confront the other side.</p>

<p>But the same valley can be the setting
for another picture: down from the top
there seem to come great processions,
gay like Benozzo Gozzoli’s ‘Procession of
the Magi,’ many leagues long and all
ordered and together, though part is
hidden in the green woods, part in the
valley’s folds. We seem to take our place
in the upward journey, and soon it will
be our turn to wonder what new thing
we shall see beyond the barrier. Perhaps
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
encompassing mists will give place
suddenly at the summit to a sunny prospect
of some great cathedral range, to
take our place in one of those processions
and descend to the richness of an Italian
land. Or, if it is on the far side that the
mists have gathered, and the gateway of
the pass is barred by a deep grey veil of
nothingness, at least the mists will lift
high enough to show the two gentle
arms of our mother earth descending to
where we are, strong and lit by a strange
internal light, ready to hold us up as we
take the last step into the grey, where we
shall see no more.

<h2 id="VII_BRITISH_HILLS">VII. BRITISH HILLS</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Not</span> much more than a hundred
years ago a tourist remarked that
he found the Scottish hills ‘most
of all disgusting when the heather was in
bloom.’ There is something very taking
about this phrase. It was, of course,
a commonplace of the eighteenth century
to feel aversion, awe, horror, even hatred
for mountains, but the epithet ‘disgusting’
is a refinement of abuse. The
Scottish hills failed to arouse any of the
deeper emotions in this gentleman&mdash;it
would have been a compliment to them
to suggest they could. They merely
filled him with disgust, and the feeling
was aggravated by the sight of a profusion
of flowers of an unpleasant purple
colour.</p>

<p>We have no reason to suppose that the
author of this judgment was deficient in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
taste or sensibility according to the
standards of his time. We may credit
him with a happy turn for expression, but
not with any originality of view. The
resulting reflections are rather surprising.
It seems natural that men should once
have looked on the Alps with horror and
repulsion. They were the abode of
storms and killing cold and avalanches,
and stood for all the forces of nature
which war most fiercely against man.
But the British hills never stood for the
negation of life. At the worst they were
only waste land, unreclaimed from nature.
So there seems to be something perversely
utilitarian in the man who could observe
their soft colours and graceful outlines
with nothing but disgust. But the
perversity&mdash;if perversity is a fair name
for the æsthetic attitude in disagreement
with our own&mdash;belonged to the age and
not to the man. To-day, no doubt, he
would have quoted descriptive poetry
with the loudest, and mountain literature
would have lost an adjective.</p>

<p>A generation or two later came the
first real explorers of our hills, and left
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
behind them a record of their sensations
in language which makes very curious
reading nowadays. It is difficult to
recognise in their precipices the gentle
slopes of Skiddaw and Helvellyn. We
cannot see things through their eyes. It
is easy to laugh at their extravagant expressions,
but perhaps after all theirs was
the Golden Age of English Mountaineering.
They left the valleys where men
dwell with the adventurous expectation
of voyagers on uncharted seas. As they
rose step by step they became conscious,
as never before, of towering height and
unplumbed depth. And when they went
home and told the tale of their adventures,
there was no unimpressionable critic
to accuse them of exaggerating the height
here or the angle of inclination there.</p>

<p>However, this happy period was short-lived.
With the exploration of the
higher Alps mountaineering terms began
to acquire a new meaning. Only quite
steep slopes were now called precipices,
and words like ‘perpendicular’ began to
have a definite objective meaning. British
hills were no longer regarded as too
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
mountainous to climb. Instead, they
were dismissed as not mountainous enough
to be worth climbing. But this, too, was
only a phase, which passed away in its
turn as the feeling for mountains became
more general. Men began to look in
their home hills for something at least of
that which they found in the Alps, and
they were not disappointed. Indeed, the
mountain feeling became at last so little
limited that the mountain lover could
find in every hill some realisation of his
longings, and he might say, with a perversion
of the old tag about humanity:
‘I am a man; all that is of the mountains
I count akin to myself.’</p>

<p>Is this, too, only a phase? A great
mountaineer, writing not so very long
ago, gave it as his opinion that the sport
of mountaineering in the Alps was
already on the decline. He may not
have been right&mdash;surely he cannot have
been right. But if even the high Alps
are in danger of vulgarisation, what may
not be the fate of our British hills? The
great god Pan is very gracious to his
worshippers, but not when they come in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
crowds. One by one his haunts are
discovered and laid bare, his chosen
sanctuaries are called by uncouth names,
even his beloved fennel is catalogued in
the list of mountain flora. The oreads
of to-day, if there were any, would be
pointed out like chamois, and would
probably suffer the common fate of
everything which is rare and beautiful.</p>

<p>This is not an unduly pessimistic picture.
In fact, it might stand as a description
of what has actually happened
in one range of hills which suffers from
too great popularity&mdash;the mountains of
Harz. The Germans are genuine lovers
of mountains, but there is something
prosaically thorough about their Schwärmerei.
Like the well-informed and
communicative frequenter of picture
galleries, they are determined to miss
nothing themselves, and to see that the
other visitors miss nothing either. And
so all well-behaved travellers in the
Harz walk along well-kept paths, sit
down on rustic benches, are admonished
by notice-boards when to admire the
view, and are provided at suitable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
intervals with the means of drinking
beer and coffee. Nothing is wanting&mdash;not
even the professional jodeler. And
yet Nature is greater than German
officialdom, and the country refuses to
be entirely spoilt. For all the time,
though no one enters them, long miles
of forest stretch away on either side of
the crowded paths; not mere woods,
which you can cross in an hour, or an
afternoon, but the original forests of all
fairy-tales. They have the gloom that
belongs to primeval pine-woods. Unchanging
and immense, they stand to-day
as they stood when they swallowed up
the Roman legionaries. Somewhere
among them Pan may still be sitting,
out of earshot of the clink of coffee-cups,
and the voice of Echo working for
hire.</p>

<p>Of course, it is unlikely that our hills
will ever fall a prey to the particular
form of municipal exploitation which
goes on in Germany. But the effect of
familiarity may be as dangerous to the
individual as that of popularity is to the
mountains. We see it in the Cumberland
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
dalesman who has never taken the
trouble to climb the hill behind his farm,
and look down into the valley on the
other side. Take him up with you, and
he will set his eyes for the first time on
half a dozen farms whose names are
often on his lips, and whose inhabitants
he has often met at Keswick Market or
the Grasmere Games. All his life long
he has taken his native hills for granted,
scarcely conscious of what he felt for
them. It is only when he exchanges
them for the flat fields of the southern
counties, or some trans-atlantic plain,
that he knows himself for a highlander
at heart. With us, it is true, the case is
different. We go to the mountains as a
refuge from the dull levels of existence.
But even for us may come a day when
there is no savour in our appreciation of the
too familiar outlines, when our eyes are
dulled and our senses blunted. For though
the contrast between the artificiality of
life and the peace and freedom of the
hills has never been so marked as it is
to-day, the step from the one to the
other has never been so short. Some of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
our hills have been turned into a sort
of suburban playground of our northern
towns, and there are times when we
seem to detect the staleness of the
suburbs even in the windy heights. The
very easiness of access becomes a snare.
Paradoxically, the contrast is sometimes
lessened and not brightened, because men
come with the atmosphere of the towns
they have left behind still clinging to
them. They come perhaps with the
same friends, and discussing the same
questions, that are part of their life at
home. Instead of sloughing the crust of
habit as they slough their city clothes,
they let it overlay their sensibilities.
The man in the street, introduced suddenly
into a theatre at an emotional
moment, sees nothing but a group of
posturing actors watched by a gaping
crowd. In the same way it is not all
gain that men can step so quickly from
the town to the mountain side. It may
mean that the mountains dwindle as the
distance is diminished.</p>

<p>We must make the most of our
mountains then, and come to them in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
right spirit, for they will never crush indifference
with the overpowering force of
fourteen thousand feet of rock and snow.
And herein lies the special charm of
rock-climbing. It provides the sharpest
possible contrast with everyday life, and
jerks the pedant out of his groove.
There are only two directions in which
the average Englishman of to-day can
get back to the bare realities of life
as a struggle of man with Nature&mdash;the
mountains and the sea. Hence the
futility of the common taunt against the
rock-climber&mdash;that he climbs his mountain
by a difficult way instead of walking
up it by the easiest; the implication, of
course, being that the truest philosophy
of life is summed up in the categorical
imperative of America&mdash;‘Get there.’
As well taunt the genuine yachtsman
because he prefers to sail his boat across
the Channel, not without danger and
discomfort, when he might go over in the
latest turbine steamer, and hardly notice
that he had ever left the land. Each
attempts in his own way to escape from
the toils of civilisation. It is not the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
impulse which is artificial and perverse,
but the conditions of life which close
all other avenues of escape.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to say how much
of the joy of climbing is physical, how
much æsthetic. The two sides react
upon each other. Perception is at its
keenest during physical exhilaration, and
conversely nothing is so conducive to a
sense of vital energy and well-being as
the appreciation of beauty. And yet
the truth of this is often unrealised.
Ruskin with his reference to the greasy
pole is typical of a large number of
people who appear to think that because
the climber’s pleasure is partly physical,
contemplation can have no part in it.
They say, too, that we should look at
mountains as at a picture which is so
hung by a thoughtful Providence that it
can only be properly appreciated from
the valleys where men are meant to
stay. We who go closer get the perspective
wrong, like the too inquisitive
critic who cannot see the picture for the
paint. Was Swinburne then less of a
poet because it was his delight to leave
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
the sheltered shore and swim out into
the sea, fighting its waves and matching
his strength against theirs? The
physical strife brings insight and understanding,
instead of negating them.
Only the sailor understands the sea,
only the climber understands the mountains.
Nor, of course, is it true that
the beauty of mountains can be best
appreciated from below. That is a
fiction invented by the plainsman to
excuse his want of enterprise. Even in
the British Isles, where the secrets of
the hills are not so well guarded as in
the Alps, there are a hundred Scottish
corries and Welsh cwms where none but
the climber ever goes. The tourist who
travels through Glencoe sees nothing so
fine as the upper cliffs of Bidian nan
Bian, or the chasms of Buchaille Etive.
Spurred on by wholly unworthy motives
he may struggle up the laborious southern
slopes of Nevis, and buy picture postcards
at the top. Under his feet the
dull amorphous summit breaks down in
splendid precipices to Alt a’ Mhuilinn.
But he will see nothing of them except
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
the dipping foreground of flat stones.
He may admire the view from the top
of Scawfell, but the climber within a few
hundred yards of him on the Pinnacle
arête is moving in another and a more
beautiful world. From across the valley
Lliwedd appears as a featureless face,
grand only in the sweep of its descent
to Cwm Dwli. But to the climber it
reveals an infinite variety of rock
scenery. There is no flat foreground
to detract from the sense of height.
The eye looks straight across a mile
of emptiness to the opposing bastions
of Crib Goch.</p>

<p>This sense of the beauty of his surroundings
can never be far from the
climber’s consciousness, though sometimes,
it is true, the physical side is
uppermost. There is the sheer gymnastic
joy that comes from the ready response
of muscle and nerve to sudden need, the
sense of perfect bodily fitness which the
Greeks prized among the best things
of life. Nowhere else does a measure
of strength and skill meet with such
a splendid reward as in the mountains.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
Down in the plains a man may live
his whole life through and never know
what it is to face danger which only his
own efforts can defeat, to strain body
and mind to the verge of absolute exhaustion.
At home he can take a train
if he is tired, put on a coat if he is cold.
Rain suggests nothing more to him than
muddy streets, or a noise on his window-pane.
Wind only emphasises the comfort
of his chair. He is a caricature
of a man, distorted by the numberless
accretions of civilisation which cover him
like an unnatural growth. He pities the
lion at the Zoo for his lost freedom, and
lives himself in a comfortable cage of his
own making. But put him down at the
foot of a Cumberland gully on a stormy
day. The first jet of icy water down his
back will wash away the affectations and
rouse the primitive man. There is no
pleasure here in the feel of the wet rocks,
no æsthetic delight in waterfalls or misty
depths, nothing but the satisfaction of
the fighting instinct which lies dormant
in every one of us. The falling water
attacks him like a living thing; it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
numbs his hands, confuses his senses,
tries to take the very heart out of him.
For once in his life at least he is face
to face with the forces of Nature&mdash;cold,
wind, and rain. If things go badly with
him, this is not a game, in which failure
means nothing more than the opportunity
of showing the spirit of the sportsman.
There is nothing chivalrous about Nature;
when she wins she presses her advantage
home. The man who challenges her
will find the water will fall more heavily,
the cold grow more numbing, just when
his own powers are on the wane. Before
he is back among his sofa-cushions he
may gain an insight into some simple
things which are usually kept under
cover in this artificial age.</p>

<p>But this is only a single side of rock-climbing,
and not perhaps the most
universally popular. There are fine-day
climbers who know nothing of this
paradoxical pleasure born of pain. But
it is the side which is generally prominent
in the winter months. In the presence
of ice and snow there is more of conflict,
less of communion with the hills. Man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
enters as an intruder, and has to make
good his footing. For that reason
perhaps the actual joy of achievement
is more keen.</p>

<p>But for pleasure unalloyed there is
nothing to equal a climb up difficult
rock on a fine summer day. Who can
describe the exhilaration that comes from
the use of muscles responsive to the call,
from the sense of mastery and ease in the
very face of danger, from the splendid
situations and wide outlook? Every
faculty is at full stretch. The whole
being is stimulated to the intensest
appreciation of beauty in all its forms&mdash;beauty
of life itself and beauty of movement,
beauty of height and depth and
distance. It must surely have been
moments such as these that Stevenson
had in mind when he prayed to the
Celestial Surgeon:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Lord, thy most pointed pleasure take<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And stab my spirit broad awake.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such moments are necessarily few. It is
one of the limitations of mortal man that
he cannot live for long upon the heights.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
But always and everywhere the climber
is most vividly alive. There are continual
appeals to so many sides of his nature
that he cannot be indifferent to them all.
Now one may come home to him, and
now another, but at least he never falls
a prey to that most deadly of all soul-diseases&mdash;apathy.</p>

<p>But though climbing, even in the
British Isles, means all that we have said
and more, far more, beside, there is just
one grain of truth lurking at the
bottom of what Ruskin said. To the
rock-climber the pure æsthetic pleasure
of contemplation comes in flashes, not
in a steady glow. There is so much to
distract him&mdash;the technicalities of his
art, the continuous attention to details,
half automatic as it may become, which
alone makes climbing justifiable&mdash;even
the voices and proximity of his companions.
For though there is nothing
discordant in the presence of sympathetic
friends, the conscious introduction of the
personal element must always widen the
gulf between man and Nature. For that
reason the climber should sometimes go
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
alone. He should let his mind be as
nearly as possible the empty cupboard of
the old metaphysicians, and leave it to
the mountains to make it a storehouse
of impressions. They will be more true
and vivid just because there are no
counter influences to weaken them or
crowd them out. If he would enter
wholly into the spirit of the hills, let him
go alone into some remote valley of the
Scottish Highlands, till the last footpath
vanishes and the highest bothy is left
behind. Let him make his bed in the
heather undisturbed by any sign of the
presence of man or of his handiwork.
The cold wind that comes with dawn
will waken him as the first thin mists
are gathering round the peaks three
thousand feet above. As he climbs the
steep slopes of heather in the half-light
the mists roll down to meet him, till he
is the only living, moving thing in a
world of whiteness and silence. The
heather dwindles, here and there black
rock-ridges show for a moment and
disappear. As in a dream he takes no
count of time or distance, till at last he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
steps out upon the summit and the sun
meets him, shining level with his eyes.
Like an ebbing tide the mists roll back
towards the valleys, leaving the mountain-tops
of Scotland shining clear in
the brilliance of the upper air. He is
alone with the hills, and stands like
one initiated into a strange and beautiful
mystery.</p>

<p>But it is of the nature of mysteries
that they cannot be interpreted to those
who do not know. To the unbeliever
they sound like mockeries&mdash;or at the
best the unmeaning fancies of ‘an idle
singer of an empty day.’ Let those
who are indifferent to mountains protest
in the name of sanity and common sense.
Perhaps the climber is to be envied his
good fortune in being something more
than sane.

<h2>ROOF-CLIMBING AT OXFORD</h2>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="VIII_ROOF_CLIMBING_AT_OXFORD">
VIII. ROOF-CLIMBING AT OXFORD</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">In</span> a book such as this, where the
University of Oxford provides the
one central sun round which, planet-wise,
the diverse essays revolve, each all
but breaking from all connection with
the rest, and only just held back by that
gravitating force&mdash;in such a book, it
would be a pity not to seek to make that
force more strong. In what way could
this be better done than by some account
of Oxford climbing, where the University
provides not only the spiritual background,
but the very physical basis of the
theme?</p>

<p>Then, too, there is another reason for
the attempt. The art of roof-climbing,
at Oxford, alas! no less than elsewhere,
is in need of defenders who will speak
out for her. Herself still inarticulate,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
she needs the good offices of any
champion she can find amidst the
universal enmity in which she finds
herself. Poor struggling wretch, in expectation
of foes, she has found them:
but has been deceived, too often, in
those that should have been friends.</p>

<p>Indigenous authority, not, perhaps,
without some show of reason, though
here and there one of its Argus eyes
may consciously wink at the art’s clandestine
or unobtrusive practice, will yet
trim the vials of punitive wrath for the
foolish one who is discovered. That
was to be looked for; but there is hardship
when brother turns on brother
(big bully on baby brother); climbers
there are that have the Alps for their
pleasure, and are privileged in acquaintance
with the princely among mountains,
who yet grudge the poor stay-at-home
his sincerest flattery, tell him he is to
be despised for his ascents, rebuked for
his foolhardiness, and chastised for his
disobedience.</p>

<p>Poor Cinderella of Climbing! May
the Prince soon come, and cast his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
favourable glance upon her. Meanwhile
let it be for me to play the part of
Matrimonial Agency, display and recite
her charms and publish them abroad,
so that perchance they may thus catch
the eye of the destined Sprig of
Royalty.</p>

<p>With forethought, knowing the fastidious
taste of these gentlemen in their
search for a true princess, let us recite
her personal charms&mdash;the glimpses of
beauty and of cold unknown secrets
which even her more humble wooer may
find&mdash;her beauty, which is the reward,
given to a mind tense and braced by
the hard labour of unwonted muscles
on slippery places. Imagine a prickly
ridge of the horned and perforated
tiles deemed suitable for roof-trees,
gained by a climb up the body of a
companion, laid flat along the sloping
roof. All around are stone and brick
ranges, peaks which more than their
Alpine counterparts deserve to be called
Clocher or Tour, showing in the
darkness little of their dilettante symmetry
of the artificial: the deep valleys
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
between filled with their rivers of light,
carrying their noisy freight along: cols
in the near range vouchsafing their
strange glimpses of the more distant:
beneath, a wide and gloomy desert, with
here and there lamp-posts for oases
of our symbol of mountain-water.</p>

<p>Throughout, a jump in nearness to the
stars, and a fellow-tingling unwarranted
by a bare forty-feet approximation to
them. By our own act we are cut off
from men: the thickness of a single
wall, if but it be the outer house-wall,
dispossesses us of our humanity, and
gives back our lost kinship with the
stars.</p>

<p>Peak and col, valley, river, and pass&mdash;all
are there: but the real, broad-sustaining
Alps do not gape suddenly
to a show of the imagined trolls of
our story-books at work beneath, and
full of unintelligible hatred against ourselves.
While here, on our tile-summits
and pipe-couloirs, we know the trolls for
a reality, their life the very negation of
the fount of our new spirit gained in
the traverse from plastered side to plain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
of a wall; the rousing of their incomprehensible
rage leading to pursuit and loss
of our world.</p>

<p>Signs of their inhabitance are all
around us: vents, traps for the feet,
showing signs of the furnaces where
they are ever at labour to fuse the dead
message of the written page into living
matter of a brain for the breathing hole
of some typho of a senseless machine,
whose groans are chained to the production
of sweetest music in College
organ-pipes; sudden lights flashed out
by one of the trolls, to the displaying
of a pair of legs spider-wise across the
entrance to his lair, or the painted globe
sphering the radiance shed upon the
small-hourly labours of the troll of
highest Matterhorn.</p>

<p>And yet the peril of them is greater
in imagination than in reality&mdash;dazzled
by the light in which he loves to bathe
himself, he cannot see the wanderer on
the heights, who may dance unobserved
in the view of public streets. The
troll-kind are like some power able to
shake the earth, and to overwhelm
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
life when the time comes, but now only
manifesting a greater grandeur to the
eyes&mdash;volcano, flame, or flood: engrossed
in their own subterranean labours, they
give scarce a thought to us, and we may
even mock at them from without; discover
yourself, however, and he becomes
the arch-enemy, like the all-powerful
earth-force, ready to annihilate those
whom it supports, and yet some evil
power they have had upon the Climber&mdash;they
have lured him to desist from
praises of his lady, and to run off in
disquisitions upon their ugly selves.
Thwart them, Climber, and return to
your Princess! She has granted Beauties&mdash;she
does not deny Adventures: no&mdash;you
may meet with strange ones on
the tops&mdash;unexpected sights that would
lose half their strangeness if they had
been known and sought.</p>

<p>One befell upon a chapel&mdash;that
chapel whose top is adorned with the
four symbolic figures known to common
repute as Faith, Hope, Charity, and
Mathematics. To the Climber they are
rather Spirits of the Heights, beckoning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
him on with enticement of gesture,
expression still alluring spite of that
strange emaciation, that attrition of
feature given to them in their high
desolate realm by the unruly Elements....</p>

<p>The chapel&mdash;if you will allow a
short excursus&mdash;is a good climb; it is
best taken from the west; the heights
once gained, there follows a spread-eagle
traverse on a ledge past the clock
(to resist setting its hands at sixes and
sevens&mdash;if that metaphor be allowed&mdash;is
hard). Thirty feet below are the flag-stones
of the quad; next time you
pass beneath the chapel arch, think
of slow midnight figures shuffling along
that narrow ledge above, feeling with
anxious feet for the unseen, unpleasant
wires, ridges, and minor anfractuosities
with which it is beset.</p>

<p>From the ledge there is a press-up
(without holds) on to the balustrade:
what may be called the shoulder is now
reached. The final pitch, a very interesting
eastward-facing pipe, is left to
climb: and then there we are in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
pure air of truth with Mathematics and
the rest of them.</p>

<p>Seldom is there space on summits for
an encounter with Adventure. Here,
however, a flat-topped balustrade runs
round the top; this, on a second visit,
we thought should be perambulated, and
perambulation was in progress when
suddenly the leader stopped short&mdash;another
step and he would have been
plunged in a crevasse. True, it was so
narrow that he could not have fallen past
his arms; but then this was none of your
smooth cold ice-cracks. It belonged to
the volcano rather than the glacier&mdash;a
square pipe leading down twistingly to
red-hot fires below. Lucky for him he
had not stepped unwarily, now to be
wedged in it, his helpless body fast, suffering
a double and simultaneous metamorphosis,
into frozen mutton above, smoked
ham below.</p>

<p>It was only a chimney really, but you
have no idea how curious a chimney
looks from above, especially a big square
one like this, without vestige of chimney-pot,
and edge flush with the balustrade in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
the centre of which it had taken it into
its head to debauch. And then its
position, thus in the very chapel&mdash;that
was strange. With the poet we asked:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘What occupation do you here pursue?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">This is a lonesome place for one like you’;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but we got no answer&mdash;the embers did
not even give one ‘flash of mild surprise,’
and we never knew what manner of man
was warmed at the blaze we had seen
dying.</p>

<p>So much for Adventure; now let us
seek Romance.</p>

<p>Wadham Gardens are beautiful&mdash;but
usually only to be seen as setting to a
flower show, to the accompaniment of
a band, and upon payment of a shilling.
The Climber sees them free of charge,
in their own self-sufficient beauty (not
decreased by the moonlight), and solitary.
Even the owls are almost silent&mdash;birds of
the twilight more than of the midnight.
The squirrels (for there are still squirrels,
even here, far within the brick-and-mortar
girdle)&mdash;they are long asleep.
The Warden is safe in bed. The Climber,
who is here partly for the garden’s sake,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
partly to prospect for a route up the
College, swishes through the soaking
grass along by the shadow of the pines
and cedars. Ha!&mdash;‘<span xml:lang="de">Wer reitet so spät
durch Nacht und Wind?</span>’&mdash;What is that
dark form that he sees ‘cross and recross
the strips of moon-blanched green’?
The Climber, cautiously approaching,
greets with joy a hedge-pig (hedgehog,
called by the general name&mdash;illogical and
less euphonious). He is very tame; even
permits a finger to stroke the only
strokeable part of him, his soft furry
stomach, before rolling up into a pin-cushion.
Leaving him thus defensive
and spherical, the Climber passes on, only
by the next tree to find another; and the
performance is repeated.</p>

<p>No route was found that night; but
as in the Alps not seldom the off-day in
the upland valley brings with birds and
flowers a new and equal joy with that of
the summits, so the moon-lit hedge-pigs
of Wadham touched a chord of romance
all their own, and vivified that night
with as strong a memory as any hard-won
roof-tree could have done.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span></p>

<p>But it is not always through such
moon-lit Edens that the Climber passes;
sometimes it is the fierce flames of the
Cities of the Plain.</p>

<p>Trinity (to make a necessary digression)
has a roof, which, once reached, is mostly
walking. It has also a quad with gravel
paving, an absence of Bodleian libraries in
close propinquity, and the usual complement
of chairs. In addition, it sometimes makes
six bumps. After one of those occasions
it was therefore not unexpected when the
Climber, perambulating the Trinity leads,
saw beyond the further roof-tree Vesuvius
in full eruption&mdash;red smoke in a whirling
column, full of blazing sparks sailing up
and off on the wind. Crawling up the
roof-tree and looking over, the Climber
saw a sight, not unfamiliar in itself, but
strange when viewed from such a viewpoint,
and with such detachment. A bit
of hell was here on earth. Devils in
deshabille were dancing round a flaming
pyre, screaming, with shrieking laughter.
Others, issuing from the dark doors round
the prison-like yard, brought with them
offerings for the fire. The iron gates that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
barred the further side of the square from
the night beyond were reminders that
none might pass out from this pit:
‘Lasciate ogni speranza’ was doubtless
inscribed upon their outer face. It was
a relief to find that the servers of the
flames brought no writhing Spirits of
the Damned, but mere inanimate combustibles.</p>

<p>Well might the Climber lie there
gazing till the flames were sinking on
to the ember-pile, and the corybantic
Zoroastrian bacchanals (for all the three
rituals they combined) had begun to
slink off to their cells.</p>

<p>To ease stiff limbs, the chapel was
taken on the homeward way; and from
its top the final flare was seen&mdash;a last
great blaze, streamers of burning paper
floating eastwards away (scaring, no
doubt, Eden’s nocturnal browsers), showers
of sparks, and then all sinking to a mere
flicker in the quiet night. And so to
bed.</p>

<p>The Climber can thus penetrate into
secret places, see strange sights, have
familiar ones for him transmogrified.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
But this is not all. Profit is combined
with pleasure. In an emergency, how
useful he can prove.</p>

<p>He may perhaps be allowed to relate
a case in point: One Lent Term, after
a heavy fall of snow, the inmates of a
certain College, which shall be nameless,
finding the snow hang heavy on their
feet, took it into their heads to take it
into their hands, and thence dispatched
it as a challenge through the windows
of their neighbour College&mdash;through the
very windows once source of light to
the famous Galetti (gone down to posterity,
by one of Clio’s whims, with
name distorted almost out of recognition).
After much shouting and the
filling of the historic chamber with snow,
the challenge was taken up.</p>

<p>I am no Homer to describe the combat,
nor were I one, would this be the place
to do so....</p>

<p>Long had they struggled, when there
arrived on the field a messenger. His
message, delivered with more jocularity
than he would have exhibited in Greek
drama, was to the effect that the Dean
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
had been peeping through some alleyway,
had seen that any direct interference
was useless, and had resorted to the
method of blockade. All the gates were
shut, and the prophets of Baal were to
be mercilessly dealt with. ‘<span xml:lang="fr">Que faire</span>’?
Hostilities ceased; earth became united
in its opposition to Olympus. Racked
brains gave birth to hasty plans&mdash;all
proved abortive, till suddenly one&mdash;a
full-armoured Minerva&mdash;flashed from its
parent’s engendering lead. ‘The Climber,
the Climber!’ was all the cry. Soon
he appeared, triumphantly escorted, and
bearing in his arms his rope. One end
of this went through the window (that
window, serving more often for the
passage of insults, not wholly unaccompanied
by injuries, now consecrated to
pacific use), and was grasped within by
six strong men. The other end became
a loop, into which the foot of one of
the aliens was inserted. No sooner this,
than, hey presto! a pull by the six,
and, an alien no longer, he was clinging
to his own country’s boundary&mdash;the
window-sill. No Customs examination
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
or landing formalities&mdash;other stalwarts
gripped him, and he disappeared into
the bowels of his fatherland, a pair of
legs for an instant waving farewell to
his late enemies.</p>

<p>This was repeated more than a score
of times, till at length not one remained
for the cunning Dean and his unwreaked
vengeance. Barred gates, alert porters,
grinning scouts, confidently waiting dons:&mdash;who
was the instrument to bring them
all to nought?&mdash;the Climber!</p>

<p>This much for its use to others. Rich
use to the Climber himself it has too.
Not only as a way out of the prosaic
world of streets and staircases into another
where for a glorious dusky hour he may
feel free, alone with himself, the night,
and active limbs, but also as a true training
for the more grave realities of nobler
peaks in other lands. General exercise
for arms (lying sadly fallow if only the
ordinary run of games be followed), and
back and legs&mdash;that is something; but
more special practice is given in lightness
of balancing and in training a dizzy head.
Cat-soft feet are needed there where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
tell-tale tiles are crossed, where dons
abound, and where sharp-hearing porters
lurk. Light, even-pulling arms alone can
with safety grip frail roof-trees, tiles, or
chimney-pots. Then, in reality, it is not
common to be above precipices of the
true vertical: here in the comfortable
city they are never to be avoided. It is
physically no doubt as easy to step across
above a plumb drop than where the
ground is sloping; but however steep
the slope, there is some comfort in it
for the untrained head, while every
crumb of it drops away down the perpendicular.</p>

<p>Soon, however, under necessity’s spell,
the reluctant cerebellum (where, I am
told, our balance-bump is to be found)
becomes used to the smooth uncompromising
walls, and the Climber can
sally qualmless forth to tackle Dolomites
or Cumberland climbs.</p>

<p>Beauty, Romance, Adventure; Help to
others; Use, both for mind and body, to
oneself: I hope the Climber has said
enough to show our Cinderella forth for
What she really is. And, gentle reader,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
you will not grumble if her champion,
for reasons not obscure, can display no
betraying blazon on his shield. Having
championed his fair, and been acclaimed
victor in the lists, he rides triumphant
forth to kneel before his sovran liege&mdash;the
British Public. ‘What is your name,
that I may honour you?’ ‘Sire, if you
will permit me, I will present you with
my card.’ Which done, he vanishes,
leaving not a wrack behind save the
white pasteboard with the two words
upon it:</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Few</span> haunters of the Alps can have
altogether escaped the dreary ceremonies
in some mountain Tabernacle,
manufactured perhaps from a drawing-room
whose windows reveal malicious
glimpses of the snows that suggest a
more acceptable service. Few but would
recognise the discourse meandering on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
from the inevitable text, that cry of the
soul to great hills afar, which constant
quotation cannot wholly mar, to the
final application which asserts that the
sojourn among the mountains is only
given that, fortified in soul and body, we
may return to the battle of life. To
some of us this pious reflection must
appear irredeemably vulgar. Those
moments on the hills when the pulses
of life seem quickened with new fire are
given for the sake, and for the sake alone,
of the moments themselves. To adapt
them to didactic disquisition is to degrade
the chief things of the ancient mountains.
For the hills are no mere nursing-home
to recuperate after the drudgery of the
plains. Those that climb to advance
science, to surpass records, to improve
their digestion miss the real appeal. For
we deserve or we do not deserve the
mountains according as we regard them
as an end in themselves or as a means
to an end.</p>

<p>An apology has already been offered
in the Introduction for a subjective treatment
of mountains. Whether the mountain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
that we loved is an entity independent
of man is a question that may be left to
philosophers to discuss. Man may or
may not be the measure of all things,
but to some extent every man undoubtedly
fashions Nature in the mould of his own
beliefs. Every mountain lover brings
something new to the common worship:
for each of us spells out a different syllable
in the universal message of the hills.
So these pages contain an attempt to
analyse one aspect of the mountains, that
aspect which is caught in childhood and
youth.</p>

<p>The thread that binds the scattered
memories of seventeen summers and
eleven winters in the Alps is the half-belief
that in some sense the mountains
are not only so many tons of rock and
ice, that they are something more than
the ruins of chaos, and possess an individuality
elusive but none the less very
real. In an uninspired age when a
dogmatic Christianity was pitted against
an even more dogmatic Rationalism, this
belief in a mountain soul found its most
poetic expression in an unsuspected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
quarter. Leslie Stephen would have
smiled grimly at any attempt to read
more than a figurative meaning into
certain passages of <i>The Alps in Winter</i>;
but no one can read that lofty confession
of an agnostic’s faith without feeling
that it is this rather than the essay of that
name which constitutes the true <i>Agnostic’s
Apology</i>. Naturalism could not resist the
mute appeal of ‘those mighty monuments
of a bygone age ... to which in spite
of all reason it is impossible not to attribute
some shadowy personality.’ And
there is the ring of something more than
fantasy in the final words: ‘Their voice
is mystic and has found discordant interpreters,
but to me at least it speaks in
tones at once more simple and more
awe-inspiring than that of any mortal
teacher.’</p>

<p>What the heart feels to-day, philosophy
may assume to-morrow. It would be
easy to find a further illustration in
Fechner’s great vision of the Earth
Soul; easy but unprofitable, for no faith,
least of all a fragile <i>Aberglaube</i> such as
this, can stand the strain of a philosophic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
formula. This sense of a conscious personality
in Nature is most powerful in
childhood. I do not pretend that our
childhood peopled its surroundings with
fairies, goblins, and similar stage supers.
Nor shall I add to the accumulations
of mischievous nonsense that have become
fashionable at a time when literature
delights, without understanding, to
dabble in the curious psychology of
childhood. The modern conception of
the child seems oddly mistaken. He is
pictured as a sexless cherub trailing
clouds of moral glory from a prenatal
paradise. But the child is non-moral,
and only acquires with difficulty and
growth the conventional ethics of his
elders. The natural child is cruel with
the cruelty that comes from an absence
of experience of pain. Without experience
his imagination has nothing to
build on, for, as that genial cynic Hobbes
remarks, ‘Pity is the imagining unto
oneself of a woe.’ The modern child
and the mediæval man have much in
common. The imagination of both is
at once vivid and restricted. From this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
springs the experimental cruelty as well
as that intense joy of life equally characteristic
of the age of childhood and
of the Middle Ages. The world of the
fifteenth century was narrower, but within
its restricted boundaries far richer in
romantic possibilities than the world as
it now exists for the ‘grown-ups.’ For
all but the child the dog-headed men have
had their day. So the narrow limits that
bounded our wanderings in those early
Grindelwald summers contained a world
instinct with an intangible romance that
the years have never expelled.</p>

<p>My first distinct mountain memory is
that of watching at the age of four Grindelwald
and our temporary home in flames.
An aunt tried to banish the terrifying spectacle
by a handkerchief round my eyes,
a needless precaution. As a proper child
I was fascinated by the prospect of
vicarious emotion, and the possibility of
some fellow-creature roasting in the
flames added interest to the drama. But
it was not Grindelwald in flames, it was
the ruthless indifference of the Eiger
insolently preening its snows in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
blood-red haze of the catastrophe that
really gripped me with fear. The
mountains bind us by their very superiority
to suffering. The unrelenting
callousness that hurls the boulders down
the gully in which we are pinned
appeals to our primitive imaginations.
‘The attitude of the creature towards
his Creator,’ said Newman, ‘should be
one of abject submission.’ ‘Not abject,’
replied some Anglican divine, ‘respectful.’
‘Not submission,’ says the
mountaineer, ‘resistance.’ Analyse the
peculiar appeal of some stern struggle
against a mountain stronghold, and it is
this sentiment that is most prominent.
Conflict without animosity makes the
strongest demand on the fighting instinct
and the faculty for worship. Like
children we like to see how far we can
go. We learn to honour the reserve of
strength that is not exerted against us
and of beauty that we cannot overcome.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Love thou the Gods and withstand them, lest thy<br /></span>
<span class="i4">fame should fail at the end&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i4">who wast born for their very friend.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span></p>

<p>Five summer months we spent in a little
village a few miles from Grindelwald.
We came in the early days of May just
as the snow began to call a late retreat
from the pastures above the chalet. We
watched the fields rich in the promise of
spring, and caught some afterglow from</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘The gleam of the first of summers on the yet untrodden grass.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The most prosaic child can fashion from a
back-garden of weeds a world of magical
fancies. So it is not surprising that we
found in our summer playground a wealth
of intimate suggestion. For it is true
of the child, as was said of Fechner,
that ‘his only extravagances are those
of thought, but these are gorgeous
ones.’</p>

<p>As the shortening days at the end of
September foretold the long winter sleep
we sorrowfully departed for the City
of Dreadful Night. The sorrows and
joys of childhood are singularly final.
The wider imagination of youth can
realise that the Alps are not irrevocably
lost when the train steams sadly out of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
the platform at Berne. No such consolations
suggested themselves to us as
children, and the weary months that had
to elapse before the next glimpse of
Paradise might as well have been eternity.
But life is vital only by contrast, and it
may have been that the mountain passion
found its strongest ally in a childhood
divided between the generous open life
of the hills and the sullen gloom of a
London Square.</p>

<p>To those days we owe the fascination
that even now invests the railway journey
to the Alps with a romance that an older
school would have us believe vanished
with the last stage-coach. Perhaps it
did for them. But for those who have
been brought up on steam, there can be
few things more provocative of wonder
than the journey to Switzerland. We
used to wait for the vigilant nurse to
trumpet forth the evidences of deep
slumber, and then gently raised the
blinds always relentlessly drawn. For us
the rattle and roar of the night express&mdash;to
some a discordant chaos of sound&mdash;seemed
‘the music nighest bordering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
upon heaven,’ a brave accompaniment
to the drama that flashed past us into
the night, dim white spaces of open
road, sleeping hamlets, shadowy trees
and waters mirroring the stars. Could
any contrast be more intense than the
sunlit joy of that first morning in Berne
when the ‘authentic air of Paradise’
seemed to linger round the terrace, and
the leaden despair of the return to
Charing Cross in a fog? I am still
susceptible to the riotous excitement of
the nights in the train. Even now I
can barely understand how any one
can remain unmoved as the train sweeps
from the gates of the Jura to reveal
beyond the morning mists the host of
peaks from the Wetterhorn to the
Blumlisalp.</p>

<p>Chalet life is a useful corrective for
those who regard the Swiss as a nation
of hotelkeepers and guides. We soon
picked up the unlovely patois, and
gradually worked our way into the life
of the village. We made friends with
the owner of the chalet, and spent long
hours on the Grindelalp watching the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
evolution of cheese. We made shameless
love to the daughter of the chalet,
now a dignified matron. A deserted
kine shed was fitted up as a temporary
home, and my brother, despite his
obvious reluctance, was required to
accept the rôle of our offspring. On
Sunday we joined the brown-coated congregation
in the white-washed Zwinglian
church, helped to swell the mournful
drone to which Luther’s sonorous hymns
are intoned, and listened with incurious
awe to the torrent of language with
which the ‘Gletcher Pfarrer’ drenched
his fold.</p>

<p>Our imagination took its suggestion
from those around us. We did not play
at soldiers or enginedrivers, for our hero
was an old guide. It is significant that
we admired him not so much for his
sixty odd ascents of the Wetterhorn as
for a mythical reputation, which we
probably evolved from our sense of the
heroic proprieties, that he beat his wife
and looked upon the wine when it was
red. Inspired by our knight of the
rope, we surreptitiously stole an old pick-axe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
and some forty feet of clothes-line,
and daily made our way to the woods
above. The will to believe is the
greatest asset of childhood, the age of
unconscious pragmatism, and we convinced
ourselves that, but for the steps
laboriously hewed from the yielding
earth, we could never have ascended so
grim a slope. One day we received a
rude awakening. A little damsel followed
us, smiled cynically at the elaborate preparations,
and then ran lightly up the
perilous incline, disdainfully dodging the
steps. The moment held material for
tragedy. We affected an air of scornful
indifference, but the pick-axe was never
disturbed again.</p>

<p>We found a more real scope for our
climbing ambition on a boulder that the
ice rivers of the dawn of time had left
stranded in the woods. Some thirty feet
in height, it fell away sheer on all sides
and gave scope for some pretty problems.
With vague memories of Bunyan we
dubbed it ‘Hill Difficulty,’ and tried to
believe that Apollyon lurked in the
neighbouring wood. Apollyon was an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
actuality for whom we entertained a
chastened respect. We thought then
that every Alpine peak was formed of
perpendicular cliffs scaled by infinitesimal
handholds. Experience has shown that
many of the climbs on this boulder were
harder than any similar short stretch on,
say, the Finsteraarhorn. Hill Difficulty,
on which we learned our craft at the
respective ages of six and four, was
really a sound training-ground. More
than once we were placed in positions
of considerable ignominy, and, for our
size, some danger. A twenty-foot fall
head first might have had awkward
results but for a helpful bush which
often proved a friend. On one fateful
occasion I remember weeping profusely
and shouting for aid to my nurse, a
humiliating experience for a mountaineer.
She, worthy dame, declined to interfere,
and beat me soundly on returning to earth.</p>

<p>When I look back on those long
summers, and try to recapture the haunting
vagueness of the first moods born
of the hills, I am faced by the insufficiency
of the written word to express
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
sensations that seem the less definite in
outline the more vividly their colour
endures. But certain broad features
stand out, and I am convinced by experience
that the normal conception of
childhood, as embodied, for instance, in
<i>The Child’s Garden of Verses</i>, is radically
wrong. Some of Blake’s detached verses,
and the poetry&mdash;written at the age of
seven&mdash;by Miss Enid Welsford, reflect
truer glimpses of that mood of savagery
and vague fear that enwraps the world
of the imaginative child, a world in
which there is little either of the cosy
or the snug. Alarming actual incidents
such as Grindelwald on fire often excite
an abstract curiosity, whilst people and
places intrinsically innocent may in a
moment become charged with cosmic
significance. Of fact and tradition the
modern child is often a sceptic. Neither
of us believed in fairies, though we
accepted with indulgence the well-meant
efforts of our elders to amuse. But to
this day I cannot explain why there
should ever have existed a well-marked
boundary in the Grindelwald woods,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
beyond which there dwelt an unhealthy
influence. I cannot understand what
fixed this bourne, nor yet why a certain
slope of scree and slag leading up to a
cluster of rock and pine should even now
seem laden with brooding fear. So,
too, though we did not believe in the
ice maiden, we yet felt that certain
mountains were, so to speak, healthy and
others provokingly sinister. The child
in touch with Nature finds his own fairy
land, and the mountains are the most
potent magicians.</p>

<p>The inner secrets of the mountain fear
are seldom revealed, for those that know
are ashamed of the atavistic emotions
that robbed them of self-control. For
the possessing terror of the lonely hills
is a thing by itself. It is most felt in
childhood, and best known to the solitary
intruder. I am not thinking of those
trying periods whose horror is at least
reducible to natural causes, of the slow
advance from step to step across an ice-slope
raked by falling stones, of the
desperate race against darkness as night
charged up from the valley, of the grim
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
struggle when retreat was and advance
seemed equally impossible:</p>

<div xml:lang="el" class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">νῦν δ’ (ἔμπης γὰρ κῆρες ἐφεστᾶσιν θανάτοιο<br /></span>
<span class="i0">μύριαι, ἃς οὐκ ἐστι φυγεῖν βροτὸν οὐδ’ ὑπαλύξαι)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">ἴομεν.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The strain of such moments is at least
healthy, but the uncanny terror that
grips the lonely victim is not. Often it
is independent of difficulty or danger.
As a boy I had wandered up to that
barren valley of barren boulders that
closes in the head of the Val d’Arpette.
There was no suggestion of gloom in the
peaceful afternoon light that cast lazy
shadows on the Clochers d’Arpette. I
was perfectly happy. Suddenly the whole
wilderness of forbidding stones seemed
fraught with evil intent. There was no
tangible reason for this transformation,
but it was sufficiently real to produce a
headlong flight. I still remember the
compelling terror that drove me to bruise
shin and elbow as I hurled myself from
boulder to boulder in a desperate attempt
to escape from a valley tenanted by the
shades of dim derisive evil.</p>

<p>The Alps merit a patient novitiate,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
and the mountaineer who does his
Matterhorn and Mont Blanc in his first
season misses the essential charm of the
hills. We spent some ten summers and
four winters in the mountains before we
even crossed the snow-line. But the
bitterness of waiting was redeemed by
the joy of long deferred fulfilment. We
learned during those years the fascination
of the lower hills, too often dismissed as
tedious grinds fit to serve only as training
walks or as exercise for an off-day in bad
weather. They are worthy of a more
loving study. There is a peculiar joy in
working patiently upwards from the
smallest of beginnings to the culminating
reward of a great peak. The landmarks
of our climbing history advanced very
slowly. There was the triumph of the
Little Scheidegg at the age of six, the
proud moment when we passed the eight
thousand level on the Brevent, and the
tantalising approach to the magic ten
thousand on the Schwarzhorn. Finally,
at the age of fifteen, I crossed the line of
perpetual snow, which for years had
haunted our dreams and marked the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
heights of earthly ambition. The
Aiguille du Tour may seem a slight
victory, but the romance of the first
night in a club hut, the first dawn seen
from the upper snows, the first generous
breadth of vision from a real mountain,
are among the unforgettable things.
Even the long deferred Matterhorn
belongs to a less splendid category of
memories.</p>

<p>Those years taught us how meaningless
is the cry that the Alps are played
out. Railways and cheap trippers, it is
said, have robbed Switzerland of all
charm. Grindelwald is simply Brighton
by the mountains, and so on and so forth.
For the railways I agree with Mr. Belloc.
‘They are the trenches that drain our
modern civilisation. Avoid them by so
much as a quarter of a mile and you
may have as much peace as would fill a
nose bag.’ Nor need we deny even to
the cheap tripper the possible possession
of a soul for the beautiful. The heritage
of the hills should not be the monopoly
of the cultured classes. In the Lötschenthal
I once met four men of that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
class which has recently begun to desert
Margate for the mountains. Their
savings were devoted to this one fortnight
in the Alps. Because guides are
expensive they confined their wanderings
to easy snow summits. Because the
<i>Climber’s Guides</i> are expensive they spent
long hours in the British Museum copying
them out into notebooks. One should
rejoice in the increased facilities of communication
into lives otherwise lacking
in colour of the saving inspiration of the
snows.</p>

<p>The complaint that the Alps are over-run
argues a barren lack of enterprise.
The Wengen Alp is confessedly somewhat
dense in the height of the season.
This troubles me not at all. Within
two hours of the Scheidegg lies one of
the most ideal of Alpine summits. To
the superficial observer the Tschuggen
may seem an unattractive scree and slate
peak, yet the actual top is a delightful
yielding carpet of springy Alpine turf
touched with the blue of late gentians.
Who will, may spend untroubled hours
here watching the clouds drifting across
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
Jungfrau, and in the north the dark
turquoise waters of Thun gleaming between
the intervening hills. Solitary,
remote, and secluded, they will scarce
remember the proximity of the hidden
hotel and its heterogeneous mob.</p>

<p>On the other side of the valley the
Faulhorn is doubly starred in Baedeker,
but fortunately the course of the double
stars is so ordered that it does not light
on the fairest of Alpine retreats. The
treasures of this chain are hidden in its
eastern wings, and you, friends, who find
Grindelwald bourgeois, do you know
that ‘very lovely, silent land’ hidden
away behind the black pyramid of the
Schwarzhorn? The long rampart that
links the Grossenegg to the Krinne is
perhaps the finest low-level wall in
Switzerland; whilst shadowed by a fold
in this curtain of rock lies one of the
chiefest of Alpine wonders. Within the
span of some thousand yards you can
trace the life of a baby glacier that has
never reached maturity. Meticulously
fashioned, with névé, ice-fall, and crevasse
on a perfect but diminutive scale, it recalls
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
the dwarf trees of Japan in its miniature
perfection.</p>

<p>So during the ten summers in which
we explored this chain in all its moods
we found for ourselves the essential romance
of the mountains. We acquired a
more extensive book knowledge of the
topography and history of the greater
peaks than most climbers we met.
<i>Scrambles in the Alps</i> was the first book
that I laboriously spelt out for myself.
Alpine literature and Alpine photographs,
such as Mr. Donkin’s, gave us a precocious
knowledge of the Alps. I remember
surprising a chance acquaintance by the
certainty with which I located the views
at an Alpine Club Exhibition, and his
comment, ‘You seem to have been
climbing for many seasons,’ had a certain
bitterness for a boy who had not crossed
the snow-line.</p>

<p>We had our foolish moments. A girl
of fifteen returning from the Eiger, and
seemingly careless of an experience for
which we would have bartered our
appetites, provoked a desperately absurd
attempt on the Wetterhorn. Without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
rope or axe we found our way to the
Gleckstein Hut. There we realised the
impossibility of any serious attempt on
the Wetterhorn itself, and turned aside
towards one of the great buttresses below
the main peak. By a nasty chimney
and an arête which would prove trying
to most unroped climbers we reached the
top of our little peak. From our feet
the great curtain of cliff that overshadows
Grindelwald fell away in one curve to
the pastures of the Scheidegg. A touch
of uncertainty as to our chance of recovering
the line of ascent added to the
majesty of that compelling precipice.
There were no traces of a previous visit,
so we proudly erected a cairn, and then,
more alarmed than we should have cared
to confess, we cautiously retraced our
steps down the ridge. On this and
similar scrambles we may have learned
something that is missed in a more
orthodox novitiate. Occasionally we
managed to borrow an axe, and derived
much amusement from the tangled
labyrinth of crevasses that can be found
among the upper reaches of the Grindelwald
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
glaciers. These expeditions were
carried out somewhat stealthily, but an
unusual and enlightened view of the
educational value of the mountains
allowed us considerable liberty of
action.</p>

<p>The hopeless call of the skyline that
we could never cross lent to the historic
gap between the Jungfrau and the Mönch
the mystery of those corners one can
never turn in dreams. When at length
we began to climb the greater peaks,
fate took us to other ranges. But after
years of waiting we at last solved the
mystery of the other side, and a six-day
journey across the glaciers of the Oberland
on ski owed its inmost charm to the
discoveries that answered the questions
of those early years. Imagination had
fashioned a mysterious conception of
those fields of unknown snow behind the
Jungfrau, and the last steps up the slope
leading to the portals of the Lötschenlücke
were quickened by the return of
the child’s desire. And when at last the
glory of the Great Aletsch snowfield,
white with the softness of a winter moon,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
gave substance to the dream&mdash;‘Behold,
the half had not been told.’</p>

<p>As a small boy I had compiled a guide-book,
in which I had affirmed that ‘the
Finsteraarhorn will test the powers of a
first-class mountaineer.’ And now as we
left our ski and passed on to its ascent,
there was a touch of sadness in the ease
with which we overcame the stronghold
that to childhood had seemed almost
impregnable. From the summit the
little chalet of those earlier summers was
just visible, and across the white recesses
of the familiar lower ranges, and across
the interval of years, our eyes seemed to
meet the eager upward looks that had so
often searched for the secrets of our
present tranquil resting-place.</p>

<p>With such surroundings for our childhood
it was almost inevitable that there
should be little room for the sentiment
with which others look back on school
and home life. The snows are a jealous
tutor, and resent a divided attention. It
might be truer to say that Grindelwald
was our real home and school. On the
first day of summer and winter holidays
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
we left for the Alps, to return only as
term began. We never talked of
‘going,’ but always of ‘going back’ to
the Grindelwald, where the chalet was
the centre of our most enduring associations.
The associations remained with
us at school. My kindliest memories of
Harrow centre round the Vaughan Library,
comfortably remote from the minor annoyances
of school life. The monitor’s key
was a very real privilege, for it gave
undisturbed possession of silent spaces
whose full beauty was only revealed during
a winter ‘first school’ when the sun shone
in awakening glory through the windowed
recesses that open on to terrace,
fields, and the low-lying hills in the
east. One shelf in particular proved
a sovereign alchemist, and an intricate
book knowledge of the Himalayas and
Caucasus was accumulated with its help
at the expense of the humaner letters.</p>

<p>The Grindelwald epoch was followed
by three summers that gave us some experience
of guideless scrambling among
third-rate snow mountains. By judiciously
choosing the worst of all conceivable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
routes we managed to discover
educative difficulties where none need
have existed. And if we are the only
people who have found a dangerous
route up the Wildstrubel, we may as
well have the discredit attaching to
that feat. The providence that cares
for the young and very foolish preserved
us among sundry and manifold perplexities.
At least we brought the axe and
rope out of the sphere of imaginative
usage, and acquired an eye for country
that we might not have gained on
first-class peaks between guides. Just as
the charm of the lower hills is too
little understood, so also the fascination
of these dependent courtiers of the
greater monarchs is woefully ignored.
These smaller mountains provide the
most natural transition from the hills
of mere imagination to the actual
mountains of romance.</p>

<p>Let me instance the Glacier de la
Plaine Morte, a field of névé on the
route to no great peaks, and rarely
visited. Its elusive magic is all its own.
Just as the quiet spell of Wordsworth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
escapes those whose taste in poetry tends
towards sound and fury, so the Plaine
Morte is a useful touchstone to discriminate
between the esoteric and
exoteric school of mountain lovers.
‘Any goose sees glory’ in the ice-fall
of the Rhone or the sweep of the
Aletsch. But if a man can see nothing
in the Plaine Morte but a somewhat
featureless field of snow, he is not one
of those to whom the precious things
of the lasting hills will yield up their
treasure. He is no dweller in the inner-most.</p>

<p>On the glaciers near Finse there is
something of the like fascination. There,
as on the Plaine Morte, the appeal
consists in no outstanding feature, but
in an impression of organic unity in
a seemingly neglected world. On the
Plaine Morte the effect is heightened
by the insignificance of the shapeless
bounding wall of low-lying shale slopes
that cut off the greater peaks. Here
also there is nothing to disturb by an
assertion of disproportionate grandeur.
There is the same secret and spacious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
charm on the Hardanger-Jokul, where
the eye travels unarrested over dim white
spaces of ice-capped plateaus only suggesting
by a suspicion of haze the
unseen fjords that sleep among their
folds, and falling away like the rhythm
of dying music to a far and grey horizon.
In such places there is an uneasy feeling
as of an unsought intrusion upon the
quiet of a world withdrawn to die, a
death with a wayward note of incompleteness:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘As though some God in his dreaming had wasted the work of his hand<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And forgotten the work of creation.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Plaine Morte is also associated with
less seemly memories. Our first guideless
venture above the snow-line took us
to the Wildstrubel. We left at midnight
without sleeping, and were dead
tired when we started home. But our
older companion should have known
better than to give himself and two
exhausted boys neat whisky as a pick-me-up.
The next distinct memory is
that of watching our friend carrying
out his suggestion that he should lead.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
His movements did not seem governed
by any concept of the shortest distance
between two points, and after a few
aimless curves he sat himself in the
snow. There was much competition to
avoid leading, as those that followed
could doze peacefully, guided and led
by the tension of the rope. Our intermittent
slumbers provoked abrupt jerks
on the rope, which as often as not
induced a unanimous collapse, followed
by a brief but peaceful repose on the
glacier. My brother’s mind was divided
between two obsessions. He identified
me with a certain ‘Hetta,’ and was
firmly convinced that I was leading
towards the wrong end of the glacier.
A violent death would have then seemed
preferable to the mental effort involved
in disabusing him of these fancies; and
I accepted with resigned disregard his
blandishments, at times unpleasantly
affectionate, and his repeated attempts
to change the line of march. As we
dragged on I became acutely conscious
of what are, I believe, two fairly common
phenomena. Movement, continued in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
extreme exhaustion, set itself to the
sound of an irritating jingle of words
that worked its way into the subconscious
mind, governed the swing of one’s
limbs, and repeated itself monotonously
till it seemed to be part and parcel of
one’s being. Again weariness awoke
that strange tendency to see faces in inanimate
objects. Familiar countenances
formed suddenly, and as suddenly resolved
themselves into grinning boulders.
Mr. Belloc may have had this in
mind:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘It darkens. I have lost the ford,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">There is a change on all things made.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The rocks have evil faces, Lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And I am awfully afraid.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Insufficient attention is paid to the
curious data that mountaineering contributes
to the psychology of exhaustion.
Experiences of a different character were
the outcome of another struggle on
the Plaine Morte against overpowering
weariness.</p>

<p>With a friend, a sound mountaineer,
but a novice on ski, I had set out some
years later to cross the hills from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
Montana to Villars. I left my friend
on the Plaine Morte, and pressed on to
reach the Wildstrubel for the sunset.
Incidentally of all mountain memories
that lonely sundown on the Wildstrubel
is the most haunting. Adelboden was
hidden, and from bourne to bourne there
was no suggestion of life but for the
deserted snow-gagged road to the Gemmi.
A chaos of crag and snowfield, with no
touch of colour to relieve the greyness,
reddened for a few moments, and then
sank back into the shadow as night crept
upwards from the valley to the summit
ridges. Darkness had fallen when I
again reached the Plaine Morte, and
one of those bitter winter breezes blew
over the glacier. Mental and physical
fatigue followed the inevitable reaction
after thirteen strenuous hours. The
monotony of surroundings has a hypnotic
effect on tired limb and brain. The
alternating spaces of shadow and snow,
subdued by the glimmering light of the
stars, the indefinite bounding wall with
a dark curving of great hills beyond,
possessed a rhythmic suggestion of sleep
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
that I found difficult to resist. I tried
counting steps, but only accentuated the
rhythm. I vowed not to look up till I
had reached the thousand, but nothing
seemed to break the maddening reiteration
of those undulating snows. And
then my hands and feet suddenly lost
sensation.</p>

<p>A steady sequence of thuds disturbed
me; and I realised that my friend was
chopping wood outside the hut some
three miles away. That Inquisition torture,
the slow succession of drops of
water falling at intervals of a minute
on the victim’s head, had, we are told,
the effect of inducing a lively loyalty to
the Catholic faith. I can well believe
it, for I know that the regular fall of the
beats carried across the glacier filled me
with zealous and unreasoning anger. It
added the last artistic touch to the
monotony of the Dead Plain, for it
followed a different rhythm, and proved
almost more than I could stand.</p>

<p>The mountain gloom is often most
pronounced below the snow-line.</p>

<p>One of our earlier climbs took us from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
the Wildstrubel Hut to the Wildhorn,
and thence without incident to the head
of the Rawyl gorge. Here the paths
divide, the westerly to Sion, the easterly
to Montana. At the dividing paths my
brother and I started cheerily along that
which leads to Montana. One of our
two companions was a middle-aged man
who considered that the experience
gained in some camping expedition in
Africa had given him an instinct for
locality. He assured us that Montana
would be found on the western flanks of
the gorge. Analogous reasoning would
lead one to look for Murren on the
slopes of the Scheidegg. We did not
like to break up the party, lest further
knowledge won on the veldt should have
even more disastrous results. So on
we wandered, while the dividing gorge
dropped ever further and further below.
I do not know what provoked the final
outburst. Perhaps they reminded us of
our youth, a sore subject. They were
the kind of men who ‘have no hesitation
in contradicting those younger than
themselves.’ At any rate we parted.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
They chanced upon a peasant who
guided them home by midnight, a
barren victory, for had they followed our
advice we should all have been home by
tea. Meanwhile we two scrambled down
some fifteen hundred feet to the boiling
torrent. This we crossed by a fallen
tree. A faint track led thence to the
lower of the two ‘bisses’ that run along
the great sweep of the mountain-side.
These ‘bisses’ are an ingenious attempt
to harness the waters that would otherwise
flow to waste, and to convey them
at a uniform gradient through a country
that is all ups and downs. The stream
guided into troughs is carried across the
face of the precipices. The troughs and
planks, which afford a passage to the
engineer and to chance but astute
visitors, are supported on poles driven
into the face of the cliff. Even in the
daytime the lower ‘bisse’ is not oversafe,
for the water escapes at intervals and
trickles over the planks. By the time
we reached it night&mdash;a sullen overclouded
night&mdash;had fallen. Slowly we began
to feel our way through the darkness,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
cautiously creeping along the slippery
treacherous platform that hung poised
above the thunder of the river. Childish
nightmares had often centred round
mountain cataracts, and to this day there
is something uncanny in the turbid
fury of an Alpine stream. We were
soon filled with useless hatred for the
unending tumult from below. Above
the gorge a crag loomed out of the
night and looked down upon us with
malicious contempt. At such moments
the mountains seem to develop a
treacherous and repellent personality.
There is something inhuman in the grim
relish with which they seem to watch a
desperate struggle.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘The hills, like giants at a hunting, lay<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Chin upon hand to see the game at bay.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The shadowy lines of forbidding precipice
crept upwards to dim clusters of
twisted pine. Below us flashed the
evanescent glimmer on the tumult of
the torrent. Its monotonous shouting
beat unceasingly about our ears. Something
of the nightmare imagery that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
inspired Kubla Khan added a note of
terror to the voice of the river as it
forced its way, through caverns measureless
to man, down to a sunless sea.</p>

<p>To the monotony of the torrent was
added the monotony of that interminable
succession of planks, winding round the
dark elbows of the ravine, always promising
to disclose a securer path, but
leading only to a like treacherous way.
At last, in despair, we tried a short cut
up through the woods. The trees rose
out of a darkness that could be felt, and
smote us in the face. We stumbled, fell,
condemned ‘the nature of things,’ and
gave up the unequal struggle to sleep
till dawn.</p>

<p>Those careless summers seem very far
away. I look back on them with some
shame and much regret. For even our
very follies had a certain educative value.
We had&mdash;in a very literal sense&mdash;to
‘work out our own salvation with fear
and trembling.’ Unfortunately, one began
to take such let-offs as a matter of
course, and during the long weary hours
in which I waited for the search-party
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
I had much leisure to reflect on that
arrogant faith in luck which is the parent
of so many disasters.</p>

<p>During the four months I spent on
my back I dared not face the prospect
that I might never climb again.
I refused to permit such a possibility.
None the less I looked forward with
peculiar dread to the vision of forbidden
snows. The first mountain that I saw
left me unmoved, though I felt a pang
of regret as the snow and fire of Ætna
climbed above the horizon of wave, for
in happier days I had wandered up its
tortured slopes. But the snow-touched
hills that swept down through vine and
olive to the sapphire belt of Nauplia’s
bay stirred no longing to penetrate into
the recesses of ranges that seemed woven
from the fabric of dreams. It was
otherwise at Garmisch. There the call
proved too strong; on two sticks I
hobbled painfully up some three thousand
feet, and the delight of watching distant
hills once more climbing into a larger
sky went to my head like wine.</p>

<p>The worst moment came at Berne.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
The thought of ‘Yesterday&mdash;many
years ago’ was never so insistent, never
so sorrowful, as on the terrace from
which I had so often caught the first
glad welcome of the snows. I looked
at the Oberland glowing in full sunlight
beyond the roofs and the morning
mists:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Into my heart an air that kills<br /></span>
<span class="i3">From yon far country blows;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">What are those blue remembered hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">What spires, what forms are those?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">That is the land of lost content;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">I see it shining plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The happy highways where I went,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And cannot come again.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To lose and recapture is to make
doubly precious. Some of the glamour
that haunted the first crossing of the
snow-line clung to the first tentative
experiments on ski. And so in the
summer past two hard-won climbs have
dispelled for ever the shadow of suspense
that darkened two years. I was working
at Montana, but somehow the long
greeting of the White trinity that cast
their spell from beyond the shadows of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
the Val’ d’Anniviers made life a burden
of vain regrets. I escaped to Zermatt,
and the same evening started for the
Dent Blanche. As I crossed the threshold
of the Schönbuhl Hut I felt like
an exile returning home. My nostrils
were gladdened by the old familiar evil
atmosphere redolent of Swiss tobacco and
the inevitable ‘Maggi’ soup. And as
I watched the magic web of twilight
creeping up the terrible northern wall
of the Matterhorn, and drank in the
silence of the upper world&mdash;a silence
that is something more than a mere
negation of sound&mdash;I felt that the lasting
rewards of the craft are not the exotic
moments of difficulty or danger, but the
humbler commonplaces of every climb,
the dawn breaking the shadows on the
snow, the vision of far horizons melting
into the roof of heaven, the peace and
radiant grace of sunset on the hills.</p>

<p>An open wound and lack of training
brought on a bad dose of mountain sickness
and made the last hour a dour
struggle, but a week later I had accommodated
myself to changed conditions, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
managed to lead over the Combin without
undue pain. Only those who have
known for months the humiliating dependence
of the sick-bed can realise the
full gladness of the rope’s responsibility.</p>

<p>There are, of course, moments of sadness
when the loss of nerve and strength
challenges comparison with the past.
The colour of things seems changed.
Lost is the old confidence on the poor
marksmanship of falling stones. Every
well-worn precaution has its meaning.
The kindly security of the rope is doubly
welcome.</p>

<p>And yet in a state of irreproachable
virtue there often escapes a great longing
for the old unregenerate days, for the
irresponsible gaiety of those chequered
hours, for all the mirth and laughter
that waited us beyond the narrow paths
of orthodoxy. There lingers still a
chastened regret for the rollicking faith
that carried one gaily in and out of
perilous places. The hills take on a
soberer colouring from the eye that has
seen the long deferred reckoning paid
in full. But though
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span></p>

<div xml:lang="de" class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Die unbegreiflich hohen Werke<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sind herrlich wie am ersten Tag,’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>though one accepts their punishment as a
small price for years of unhampered joy,
there are none the less moments of irrational
passionate revolt, moments in which one
would buy back with a year of the life
that is left one solitary hour among the
untroubled mountains of youth.</p>

from the point of view of the “one-sport” man, but the common commonplace
view of the all-round sportsman taking a holiday. Such a book really
encourages people to try a single-handed cruise.’&mdash;<i>The Field.</i>

<p>These interesting reminiscences of an Army Surgeon on active service
cover a wide field of work. Beginning with early years of service in the
West Indies, the author soon proceeded to the Crimea, where he remained
until peace was declared. A year or two afterwards he joined
the expeditionary force destined for China, which was deflected to India
by the news of the Mutiny. He was present at the Relief of Lucknow,
and won the Victoria Cross for his “persevering bravery and admirable
conduct” on that occasion. In 1860 we find him in the East again
during the China War, advancing with the Allied Forces to Pekin. At
the close of 1861, when the Civil War in America seemed likely to embroil
Great Britain, Surgeon Home was sent out to Canada, in readiness
for anything that might occur. Fortunately the clouds lifted, and before
his return to England the author was able to visit Baltimore and
Washington, where he gained many interesting impressions of the war
then in progress. The volume concludes with an episode in the Maori
War in New Zealand in 1864.

<p>“I stand amazed by the qualities of the author’s genius. She really can create characters,
quite original, and, as it were, not fanciful, not fantastic, but solid samples of human nature.
When one lights on something really good in contemporary fiction one has pleasure in saying
how excellent one finds the rarity.”&mdash;Mr. <span class="smcap">Andrew Lang</span> in the <i>Illustrated London News</i>.</p>

<p>“‘Tante’ is a fine piece of work, well thought out, well constructed, and full of human
nature. There is no possible doubt that it will stand out among the most distinguished
novels of the year.”&mdash;<i>Daily Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>“There can be but one opinion as to the merits of this entirely fascinating and able novel,
which marks a fresh stage in the development of one of the most remarkable writers of the
present day.”&mdash;<i>Westminster Gazette.</i></p>

<p>“One does not know of any woman writing novels in England to-day who is capable of
anything so imposing in invention and so refined in execution as ‘Tante.’ ‘Tante’ is a
remarkable novel, full of brilliant things and of beautiful things&mdash;the strongest work of a
very distinguished writer.”&mdash;<i>Manchester Guardian.</i></p>

<p>“A work of rare distinction. ‘The Bracknels’ is more than brilliant; it is actual; it
is true; it is an accurate reproduction of an experience.”&mdash;<i>Daily News.</i></p>

<p>“An admirable novel, from which one has had no ordinary amount of pleasure.”&mdash;<i>Manchester

<h3>MORE GHOST STORIES.<br />
<br />

Author of “Ghost Stories of an Antiquary,” etc.</span><br />
<br />
<i>Medium 8vo.</i>       <b class="i4">6s.</b>       <i class="i4">Second Impression.</i></span></h3>

<p>“I wish to place myself on record as unreservedly recommending ‘More Ghost Stories.’
It is Dr. James’s method that makes his tales so fascinating. As he puts it in his preface, a
ghost story ought to be told in such a way that the reader shall say to himself: ‘If I am not
very careful something of this kind may happen to me.’”&mdash;<i>Punch.</i></p>

<p>“What makes these stories impressive is not only the artistic skill shown in the application
of supernatural elements, but the air of vraisemblance that distinguishes each narrative.
Dr. James is a master of the art of ‘true relation.’”&mdash;<i>Westminster Gazette.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><b><span class="large">LOVE IN BLACK.</span></b> By Sir <span class="smcap">H. Hesketh Bell</span>,
K.C.M.G., Governor of Northern Nigeria. <b>6s.</b></p>

<p>“The last volume in our list also concerns West Africa. Sir Hesketh Bell’s ‘Love in
Black’ is a delightful and successful experiment in a very difficult form of art. His seven
short stories are almost wholly concerned with native life, but out of his far-away material
he constructs very living dramas. The grim irony of the ‘Yam Custom’ and ‘A Woman of
Ashanti,’ the broad comedy of ‘His Highness Prince Kwakoo,’ and the pathos of ‘On Her
Majesty’s Service’ are relieved by such charming idylls as the title-story and ‘The Tale of a
Tail-Girl.’ A curious tenderness, especially when dealing with children, and a very real imaginative
sympathy are the keynotes of the book.”&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i>

<p>“The scope of Mrs. Handley’s book is quite inadequately indicated by the title; it really
forms a welcome addition to our knowledge of the vast and complex subject of India in that
it contains the impressions of a keen and shrewd observer on many Indian races, their
manners, customs, religions, virtues, vices, and idiosyncrasies, as well as admirable descriptions
of scenery, vivid accounts of hunting incidents and travel episodes, and instructive
little asides on the political and economical, social and racial problems of the great peninsula.
We recommend the book thoroughly; it is well written in a style that is as attractive as it is
sound, and the matter is worthy of all consideration.”&mdash;<i>Standard.</i></p>

<h3>Miss Loane’s Books on the Lives
of the Poor.</h3>

<p>Miss Loane was a district nurse; she lived among the poor and for
the poor; she knows the society of the poor from the inside, yet she comes
in from the outside, consequently she sees closely enough to descry details
accurately. There are no volumes of statistics, however precise, and no
books about poor relief, however true to history, which can teach us what
Miss Loane has learned.</p>

The charge that Cézanne’s work displays a ‘personal

notes on the Grafton Exhibition in 1910, and though
denied by some critics is completely borne out by the
judgment of those who knew the artist personally.

Of the claim of Segantini to be considered the true
mountain artist I speak with some diffidence, as my
acquaintance with him is small. But from what I have
seen, I should say that he found himself unable to get
away from the contrast between human figures and landscape
which hampered the early English water-colourists,
with the result that the spirit of the mountains does not
dominate his pictures. In any case, his outlook is purely
that of the naturalist, and if he is right, then Mr.
Holmes is wrong&mdash;a conclusion to which I cannot
subscribe.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
